# The imaginary constant

Imaginary and complex numbers are based around a single letter, which
effectively acts as an unknown constant. This is $i$.

## The value of $i$

$i$ is equal to the square root of $1$. This can be written in either of the
following forms:

$$
i=\sqrt{-1}
$$

$$
i^2=-1
$$

## Simplifying imaginary numbers

The second form has some interesting use-cases. Because we know that $i^2=-1$,
we can rewrite any power of $i$ as a simple **real number**, or as just a
coefficient of $i$.

### Example: Simplify $i^3$

- $i^3=i^2\times i$
- $i^3=-1\times i$
- $i^3=-i$

### Example: Simplify $i^4$

- $i^4=i^2\times i^2$
- $i^4=-1\times-1$
- $i^4=1$

### Example: Simplify $-7i^2$

- $-7i^2=-7\times i^2$
- $-7i^2=-7\times-1$
- $-7i^2=7$
