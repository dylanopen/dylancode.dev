# Quadratic functions and their graphs

A **quadratic function** is a type of polynomial function that can be written in
the form:

$$
f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
$$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and $a\ne0$.

## Quadratic graph shape

The shape of a quadratic function is called a **parabola**.

*Positive* quadratics have the shape of a *positive parabola* - they are upwards
sloping (u-shape).

*Negative* quadratics have the shape of a *negative parabola* - they are
downwards sloping (n-shape).
