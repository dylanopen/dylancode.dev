# Quadratic functions and their graphs

A **quadratic function** is a type of polynomial function that can be written in
the form:

$$
f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
$$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and $a\ne0$.

## Quadratic graph shape

The shape of a quadratic function is called a **parabola**.

*Positive* quadratics have the shape of a *positive parabola* - they are upwards
sloping (u-shape).

*Negative* quadratics have the shape of a *negative parabola* - they are
downwards sloping (n-shape).

### Example: identify the shape of $y=x^2+3x+2$

Since $a=1$ (which is positive), this is a positive parabola - it has a u-shape.

### Example: identify the shape of $y=-2x^2+5x-1$

Since $a=-2$ (which is negative), this is a negative parabola - it has an n-shape.

## Finding the y-intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis (where $x=0$).

To find the y-intercept, substitute $x=0$ into the equation.

### Example: find the y-intercept of $y=x^2+3x+2$

- Substitute $x=0$: $y=0^2+3(0)+2$
- $y=2$
- The y-intercept is at $(0, 2)$.

### Example: find the y-intercept of $y=2x^2-5x+7$

- Substitute $x=0$: $y=2(0)^2-5(0)+7$
- $y=7$
- The y-intercept is at $(0, 7)$.
