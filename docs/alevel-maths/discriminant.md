# The discriminant of a quadratic equation

The *discriminant* of a quadratic equation is calculated using the part under
the square root in the **quadratic formula**.

$$
D=b^2-4ac
$$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in the
form $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

## Symbol for the discriminant

The discriminant is usually represented by the greek letter *delta$ ($\Delta$).
In this chapter, we will refer to it by the letter $D$.

## Uses of the discriminant

The discriminant tells us the number of *real* roots that a quadratic equation
has.  
This is really useful, because it can be used to tell us whether it is possible
to solve an equation or not.

It can also be used to find a constant in a quadratic equation (e.g. to find $k$
in the equation $x^2+kx+4=0$), if we are given that, for example, the equation
has one real root.

## Finding the number of roots of an equation

We can find the number of real roots by working out the value of the discrimant.
We can do that by calculating $D=b^2-4ac$.
- If $D>0$, there are two distinct real roots.
- If $D=0$, there is one real root (a repeated root).
- If $D<0$, there are no real roots (the roots are all complex/imaginary).

### Example: find the number of roots of $x^2+5x+6=0$

- $a=1$, $b=5$, $c=6$
- $D=b^2-4ac$
- $D=5^2-4(1)(6)$
- $D=25-24$
- $D=1$
- Since $D>0$, there are two distinct real roots.

### Example: find the number of roots of $x^2-4x+4=0$

- $a=1$, $b=-4$, $c=4$
- $D=b^2-4ac$
- $D=(-4)^2-4(1)(4)$
- $D=16-16$
- $D=0$
- Since $D=0$, there is one real root (a repeated root).

## Finding a constant using the discriminant

We can also use the discriminant to find a constant in a quadratic equation
(where one of $a$, $b$ or $c$ has a non-integer coefficient, such as $k$).
For example, if we are given that a quadratic equation has one real root, we
can set $D=0$ and solve for the constant.

### Example: find $k$ if $x^2+kx+9=0$ has one real root

Since the equation has one real root, $D=0$.

- $a=1$, $b=k$, $c=9$
- $D=b^2-4ac$
- $0=k^2-4(1)(9)$
- $0=k^2-36$
- $k^2=36$
- $k=\pm6$

### Example: find $p$ if $2x^2+4x+p=0$ has two distinct real roots

Since the equation has two distinct real roots, $D>0$.

- $a=2$, $b=4$, $c=p$
- $D=b^2-4ac$
- $D=4^2-4(2)(p)$
- $D=16-8p$
- For two distinct real roots: $16-8p>0$
- $16>8p$
- $p<2$

## Repeated roots

When a quadratic equation has one real root (i.e. when $D=0$), this is called
a *repeated root*.  
This means that both roots of the equation are the same (i.e. they are equal) -
and so we kind of only have one solution instead of the usual two.
