# The logarithm function

$$
\log_2\space16=4\Leftrightarrow2^4=16
$$

## Common bases of logarithms

- **Base 10**: historically, logarithms were written down in 'logarithm books'.
  These books showed all of their logarithms to base 10.
- **Base e**: *natural* logarithms. Euler's number is the 'natural base' of
  logarithms.

## Natural logarithm function

$$
\ln(x)=y\Leftrightarrow \log_e(x)=y\Leftrightarrow e^{y}=x
$$

Essentially, $\ln(x)$ is just another way of writing $\log_e(x)$. We use $e$ all
the time in logarithms, so it is easier to write $\ln(x)$ instead of
$\log_e(x)$.
