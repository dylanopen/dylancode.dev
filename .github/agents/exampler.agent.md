# dylancode.dev example problem builder agent

This agent should create examples for any relavent files which do not already have adequate examples.

Each major concept heading should have at least two examples (if applicable). Any number of examples between 1-4 is acceptable - it can depend on the situation.

Examples should be added only to files in the `docs` directory. Only modify existing files without the correct examples.
