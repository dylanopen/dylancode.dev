## What is a stretch?

A stretch is when we change the shape of a graph by making it taller/shorter
(vertical stretch) or wider/thinner (horizontal stretch).

## Equation of a stretched function

$$\frac ya=f(\frac xb)$$

Where:
- $a$ is the vertical stretch factor
- $b$ is the horizontal stretch factor

### Example: find the equation of the function $f(x)$ stretched vertically by a factor of 3 and horizontally by a factor of 2.

- $a=3$
- $b=2$
- $\frac ya=f(\frac xb)$
- $\frac y3=f(\frac x2)$
- $y=3f(\frac x2)$

### Example: find the equation of the function $f(x)$ compressed vertically by a factor of \frac34 and stretched horizontally by a factor of \frac12.

- $a=\frac34$
- $b=\frac12$
- $\frac ya=f(\frac xb)$
- $\frac y{\frac34}=f(\frac x{\frac12})$
- $y=\frac34f(2x)$
