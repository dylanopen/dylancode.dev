$$
\log_2\space16=4\Leftrightarrow2^4=16
$$

## Common bases of logarithms

- **Base 10**: historically, logarithms were written down in 'logarithm books'.
  These books showed all of their logarithms to base 10.
- **Base e**: *natural* logarithms. Euler's number is the 'natural base' of
  logarithms.

## Natural logarithm function

$$
\ln(x)=y\Leftrightarrow \log_e(x)=y\Leftrightarrow e^{y}=x
$$

Essentially, $\ln(x)$ is just another way of writing $\log_e(x)$. We use $e$ all
the time in logarithms, so it is easier to write $\ln(x)$ instead of
$\log_e(x)$.

## Logarithm function constraints

- In the function $\log_aa^x$:
  - $a>0$
  - $a\neq1$
  - $x>0$

### Example: solve for $x$: $3\ln(2+x)=6$

- Divide both sides by 3:
  - $\ln(2+x)=2$
- Rewrite the logarithm as a power of $e$:
  - $e^2=2+x$
- Subtract 2 from both sides:
  - $e^2-2=x$
- Therefore, the solution is:
  - $x=e^2-2$
