title: Modulus of a linear function
---

## What is the modulus of a function?

The modulus (or 'absolute value') of a function makes all the negative values
positive.

This means that the $y$ values of the graph will never be negative.

## Representing modulus

We write the modulus (or 'absolute value') of a function like this:
$$y = |f(x)|$$.

## Graph of the modulus of a linear function

The graph of the modulus of a linear function $y = |mx + c|$ looks like a 'V'
shape.

That's because the part of the graph where $mx + c$ is negative is reflected
above the $x$-axis.
