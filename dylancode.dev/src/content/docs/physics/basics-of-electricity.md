## Electrical current

- Current is the **rate of flow of charge**.
- The symbol for current is $I$.
- The unit of current is the **ampere** ($A$).
- 1 ampere is equal to 1 coulomb of charge passing through a point in 1 second.
- The current can be measured using an ammeter.

### Current equation

$$
\text{current} = \frac{\text{change in charge}}{\text{change in time}}
$$

$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$

## Potential difference

- Potential difference is the **work done by unit charge**.
- It's also called 'voltage'.
- If the potential difference across a component is, for example, $6V$, that
  menas that $1C$ of charge transfers $6J$ of energy to the component.
- It's called the 'potential difference' because it is the difference in energy
  (work done) or volts across a component.
- Potential difference can be measured with a **voltmeter**.

### Potential difference equation

$$
\text{potential difference} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{charge}}
$$

$$
V=\frac WQ
$$

## Types of voltage

There are two types of energy transfers in 
- When energy is 'lost' by a coulomb (i.e. 'given' to a component), it's called
  'potential difference'.
- When energy is 'gained' by a coulomb (usually from a cell), it's called 
  'EMF'.

## Charge

- Charge is measured in **Couloms**.
- One coulomb is equal to $6.25\times10^{18}$ electrons! It's an easier way to
  measure charge than counting the septillions of electrons.

## Electrical circuit

- An electrical circuit is an **energy delivery system**.
- It takes energy from the cell/battery and 'drops it off' at the components
  (such as the bulb).

## Resistance

- Resistance is the **opposition to the flow of current**.
- The symbol for resistance is $R$.
- The unit of resistance is the **ohm** ($\Omega$).
- A larger resistance means a smaller current for a given potential difference.
- It also transfers electrical energy into other forms (usually heat).

### Resistance equation

$$
\text{potential difference} = \text{current} \times \text{resistance}
$$
