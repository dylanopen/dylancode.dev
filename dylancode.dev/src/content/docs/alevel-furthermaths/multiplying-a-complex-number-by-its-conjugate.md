title: Multiplying a complex number by its conjugate
---

In the same way that multiplying a bracket involving a *surd* by the *conjugate*
of the bracket will produce a rational number, the same is try for multiplying
a complex number by the complex conjugate.

Multiplying a complex number by its conjugate will always result in a real
number.

## Proof

- Let $z=x+yi$. $x$ and $y$ are real.
- $z^*=x-yi$
- $(x+yi)(x-yi)=x^2+xyi-xyi-y^2i^2$
- $(x+yi)(x-yi)=x^2-y^2i^2$
- $(x+yi)(x-yi)=x^2-y^2(-1)$
- $(x+yi)(x-yi)=x^2+y^2$
- $x$ and $y$ are real, so $x^2+y^2$ is real.

## Example: find $z$ such that $3z+2z^*=5+2i$

- Let $z=x+yi$
- $z^*=x-yi$
- $3(x+yi)+2(x-yi)=5+2i$
- $3x+3yi+2x-2yi=5+2i$
- $5x+yi=5+2i$
- $5x=5$, $x=1$
- $1y=2$, $y=2$
- $z=x+yi$
- $z=1+2i$
