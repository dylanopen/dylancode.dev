## Proportionality of exponential graphs

- For $y=a^x$, the gradient $\frac{dy}{dx}$ of the graph at any point is
  [directly proportional](/direct-proportion) to the value of $y$ at that point.

## Graph of $y=e^x$

- The graph of $y=e^x$ passes through the point $(0,1)$.
- The graph of $y=e^x$ increases faster than any other exponential graph
  $y=a^x$ where $a>1$.
- The graph of $y=e^x$ decreases slower than any other exponential graph
  $y=a^x$ where $0<a<1$.
- The derivative of $y=e^x$ is equal to $e^x$ itself:
  - $\frac{dy}{dx} e^x = e^x$

Any exponential function can be expressed in terms of $e$:
- $a^x = e^{(\ln a)x}$

## Asymptotes

For the function $y=a^x$:
- There is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$ (the x-axis).

## Approaching infinity

- For $y=a^x$:
  - As $x \to +\infty$, $y \to +\infty$.
  - As $x \to -\infty$, $y \to 0$.
- The rate of increase of $y$ becomes faster as $x$ increases.
- The rate of decrease of $y$ becomes slower as $x$ decreases.
- The function never actually reaches $y=0$; it only approaches it as an
  asymptote.

## Graph of an inverse function

- The inverse of a graph is the reflection of the graph in the line $y=x$.
