## What is a prime number?

A prime number is any number which only has two factors: 1 and itself.

## Examples of prime numbers

- $2$ (factors: $1$, $2$)
- $3$ (factors: $1$, $3$)
- $5$ (factors: $1$, $5$)
- $29$ (factors: $1$, $29$)
- $97$ (factors: $1$, $97$)

## Non-examples of prime numbers

- $4$ (factors: $1$, $2$, $4$) - three factors
- $6$ (factors: $1$, $2$, $3$, $6$) - four factors
- $9$ (factors: $1$, $3$, $9$) - three factors
- $15$ (factors: $1$, $3$, $5$, $15$) - four factors
- $1$ (factors: $1$) - only one factor
- $6.5$ - not prime as it is not an *integer* (whole number)

## [Composite numbers](composite-numbers)

You may think that all non-prime numbers are composite numbers, and you'd be
right... usually.

The number $1$ has only one factor: $1$, so it is *not* prime because it does
not have 2 factors.  
It is also not composite, because composite numbers have **more than** 2
factors.
