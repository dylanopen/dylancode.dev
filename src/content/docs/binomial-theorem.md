title: Binomial theorem
---

The binomial theorem is a way of expanding expressions of the form
$(a+b)^n$ fully, without having to multiply it out by hand.

The binomial theorem states that:

> $$
> (a+b)^n = a^n + \binom{n}{1} a^{n-1}b + \cdots + \binom nr a^{n-r}b^r + \cdots + \binom{n}{n-1} ab^{n-1} + b^n
> $$

It's basically just a way of writing the *full* expansion of a binomial
expression as a formula. You already know all this from the previous articles!
