title: Refractive index
---

The *refractive index* tells you the speed at which light will pass through a
specific material:

- A **higher** refractive index means the light moves more **slowly**
  - During refraction, it will bend **towards** the normal.
- A **lower** refractive index means the light moves more **quickly**
  - During refraction, it will bend **away from** the normal.

## Calculating the refractive index

If we have a material which has a refractive index of $n$, and light travels
through it at a speed $c_s$, we can represent this relationship with this 
equation:

$$
n=\frac c{c_s}
$$

- $n$ is the refractive index of the material - it has *no unit* because it's
  a ratio.
- $c$ is the speed of light in a **vacuum** - measured in $ms^{-1}$
- $c_s$ is the speed of light through the **material** - measured in $ms^{-1}$
