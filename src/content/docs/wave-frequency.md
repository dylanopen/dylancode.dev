title: Wave frequency
---

The **frequency** of a wave is the number of *complete* waves that pass a given
point in one second.

## Notation

We usually use the letter $f$ to represent frequency. Nice and simple :)

## Units

Frequency is measured in **hertz** ($Hz$).

One hertz is equal to one wave passing a point per second.

## Calculating frequency

Frequency can be calculated using the re-arranged formula for
[wavelength](/wavelength) and [wave speed](/wave-speed):

$$
\text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{Speed of wave}}{\text{Wavelength}}
$$

Or, using symbols:

$$
f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
$$

Where:
- $f$ is the frequency (in hertz, $Hz$)
- $v$ is the [speed of the wave](/wave-speed) (in metres per second, $m/s$)
- $\lambda$ is the [wavelength](/wavelength) of the wave (in metres, $m$)

## Relationship with wavelength

It is *inversely proportional* to the [wavelength](/wavelength) of the wave -
that is, as frequency increases, wavelength decreases, and vice versa.

> This assumes that the speed of the wave remains constant.
