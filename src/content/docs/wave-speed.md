title: Wave speed
---

The **wave speed** is the speed at which a wave propagates through a medium.

Effectively, if we pick any point on the wave, it's how fast that point moves.

## Notation

We usually use the letter $v$ to represent wave speed (for velocity).

## Units

Wave speed is measured in **metres per second** ($m/s$).

## Calculating wave speed

Wave speed can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Wave speed} = \text{Frequency} \times \text{Wavelength}
$$

Or, using our symbols:

$$
v = f\lambda
$$

Where:
- $v$ is the wave speed (in metres per second, $m/s$)
- $f$ is the [frequency](/wave-frequency) of the wave (in hertz, $Hz$)
- $\lambda$ is the [wavelength](/wavelength) of the wave (in metres, $m$)

> Logically, this makes sense.  
> If a wave has a high frequency (more waves per second) it must be moving
  faster.
> Similarly, if a wave has a long wavelength (more distance between waves), it
  must also be moving faster.
