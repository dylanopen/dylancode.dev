title: Parallel line equations
---

Two lines are parallel if they will never meet, no matter how far they are
extended.

The key thing to remember when looking at their *equations* is that:

> **parallel lines have the same gradient**

From this knowledge, we can find the equation of any line if we know that it's 
parallel to a line that we know, and we know a point that the new line goes
through.

### Example: find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 2x + 3$ that goes through the point (4, 5)

- Gradient of original line is $2$
- So the gradient of the new line is also $2$
- We know that one of the points on the new line is (4, 5), so when $x=4$, $y=5$.
- We can substitute these values into the equation of a straight line:
  - $y = mx + c$
  - $5 = 2 \times 4 + c$
  - $5 = 8 + c$
  - $c = 5 - 8$
  - $c = -3$
- The $y-intercept$ ($c$) is $-3$, so write the equation for a line with
  gradient $2$ and $y-intercept$ $-3$:
  - $y = 2x - 3$

- **Answer**: $y = 2x - 3$

### Example: find the equation of the line parallel to $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$ that goes through the point (6, 1)

- Gradient of original line is $-\frac{1}{2}$
- So the gradient of the new line is also $-\frac{1}{2}$
- We know that one of the points on the new line is (6, 1), so when $x=6$, $y=1$.
- We can substitute these values into the equation of a straight line:
  - $y = mx + c$
  - $1 = -\frac{1}{2} \times 6 + c$
  - $1 = -3 + c$
  - $c = 1 + 3$
  - $c = 4$
- The y-intercept ($c$) is $4$, so write the equation for a line with
  gradient $-\frac{1}{2}$ and $y-intercept$ $4$:
  - $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$

- **Answer**: $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$

### Example: find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 3x - 2$ that goes through the point (2, 7)

- Gradient of original line is $3$
- So the gradient of the new line is also $3$
- We know that one of the points on the new line is (2, 7), so when $x=2$, $y=7$.
- We can substitute these values into the equation of a straight line:
  - $y = mx + c$
  - $7 = 3 \times 2 + c$
  - $7 = 6 + c$
  - $c = 7 - 6$
  - $c = 1$
- The -intercept ($c$) is $1$, so write the equation for a line with
  gradient $3$ and $y-intercept$ $1$:
  - $y = 3x + 1$

- **Answer**: $y = 3x + 1$
