title: Polarisation
---

*Polarisation* is when we take an [*unpolarised* transverse wave](/polarised/wave)
and 'filter' it such that the oscillations (vibrations) only occur in a **single
plane**.

This can be useful, see [uses of polarisation](/uses-of-polarisation).

## How do we polarise waves?

Unpolarised waves have oscillations occuring in all sorts of directions. We
*only* want to 'let through' one of those directions, so we need some way of
filtering out the other directions.

To do that, it's actually quite simple - we just create a 'slot' for the wave
that is oscillating in the desired direction to pass through, while blocking the
other directions.

For example, if we want to polarise a wave so that the oscillations occur in the
vertical direction, we can create a vertical 'slot' for the wave to pass
through. Then, waves oscillating in the horizontal direction (or any other
direction) will be blocked.

## Polaroid

Most waves aren't exactly that big though, so we can't just cut a slot into
a piece of cardboard or something and expect it to work. Instead, we use a
special material called *polaroid*.

It's made up of long-chain molecules that are all aligned in the same
direction. When an unpolarised wave passes through the polaroid, only the
component of the wave that is oscillating in the same direction as the
molecules is allowed to pass through - the rest is absorbed by the material.

For example, if the polaroid is aligned vertically, only the vertical
component of the wave will pass through, while the horizontal component will
be absorbed.

This *essentially* creates a 'slot' for the wave to pass through, just on a
much smaller scale.
