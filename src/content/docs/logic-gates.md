title: Logic gates
---

In the simplest possible terms, a *logic gate* is a tiny electronic component
that takes one or more electrical signals as input and produces a single
electrical signal as output, based on specific rules.

For example, we may have one of these components which takes two input signals
and produces an output signal that is only "on" if *both* input signals are
"on".
