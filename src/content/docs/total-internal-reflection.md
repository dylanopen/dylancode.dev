title: Total internal reflection
---

## When does total internal reflection happen?

- $n_1>n_2$
- $i>\theta_c$ ($\theta_c$ is the **critical angle**)

## What can happen?

- The light wave can be refracted
- Or, the light wave can be reflected

## Critical angle

The critical angle is the angle at which the light waves stop being refracted,
and are instead **reflected**.

## Calculating the critical angle

$$
\sin\theta_c=\frac{n_2}{n_1}
$$
