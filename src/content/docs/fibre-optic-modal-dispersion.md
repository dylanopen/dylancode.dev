title: Fibre optic modal dispersion
---

In a [fibre-optic cable](/fibre-optic-cable), the light can be shone through at
different angles.

If the light is shone at an angle closer to the normal, it will bounce *more
times*, which means it will travel a further distance in total.

Knowing that $\text{time}=\text{distance}\div\text{speed}$, we know that if
distance increases, the time taken will also increase.

Modal dispersion is when the light takes different lengths of time to arrive,
depending on the angle it is shone through the cable at.

## Solution

If we use *very narrow* fibres, the difference in distance between the different
possible routes (angles) is smaller, so this becomes less of an issue.

> In short, the solution is to use narrow fibres.
