## Commutativity

- A binary operator is *commutative* if changing the order of the inputs doesn't
  change the output.
- For example, addition ($+$) is commutative because $a + b = b + a$ for any
  numbers $a$ and $b$.
- Multiplication ($*$) is also commutative: $a * b = b * a$.
- However, subtraction ($-$) and division ($/$) are *not* commutative:
  - $a - b$ is generally not equal to $b - a$.
  - $a / b$ is generally not equal to $b / a$.
  - Exponentiation (`^`) - powers - are also not commutative: $a^b$ is generally
    not equal to $b^a$.

## Associativity

- A binary operator is *associative* if the way in which inputs are grouped does
  not affect the output.
- For example, addition is associative because $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ for
  any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
- Multiplication is also associative: $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
- However, subtraction and division are *not* associative:
  - $(a - b) - c$ is generally not equal to $a - (b - c)$.
  - $(a / b) / c$ is generally not equal to $a / (b / c)$.
  - Exponentiation is also not associative: $(a^b)^c$ is generally not equal to
    $a^(b^c)$.

## Identity elements

- If $e*a=a*e$ for ALL values in the set, $e$ is the identity.
- For addition, for example, the identity is $0$, because $0 + a = a + 0 = a$
  for any number $a$.
- For multiplication, the identity is $1$, because $1 * a = a * 1 = a$ for any
  number $a$.

> The inverse of the identity element is the identity element itself.

## Inverse elements

- The inverse element is the 
- If $a*b=b*a=e$, $a$ and $b$ are *inverse* of each other.
- For addition, the inverse of a number $a$ is $-a$, because $a + (-a) = (-a) +
  a = 0$.
- For multiplication, the inverse of a number $a$ (assuming $a \neq 0$) is
  $\frac{1}{a}$, because $a * \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{a} * a = 1$.
