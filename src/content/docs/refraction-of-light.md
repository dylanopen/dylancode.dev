title: Refraction of light
---

*Refraction* is when light 'bends' (changes direction) when it enters a new
*medium* (material).

This is because it travels at a different *speed* through different materials
\- and as the speed changes, so does the direction of the propegation of energy
in the wave.

## Calculating the angle of refraction

We can find the angle of refraction using [Snell's law].
