title: Polar coordinate identities
---

There's a few things that we can say are true when working with polar
coordinates - *identities*.

They're really useful especially later on, when we'll use them to convert from
polar forms to cartesian forms, and the other way round.

## $x=r\cos\theta$

We know this because $\cos\theta=\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, and
in this case the adjacent side is $x$ and the hypotenuse is $r$.

So $\cos\theta=\frac{x}{r}$, and rearranging gives us $x=r\cos\theta$.

## $y=r\sin\theta$

We know *this* one because $\sin\theta=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, and in this case the opposite side is $y$ and the hypotenuse is $r$.
So $\sin\theta=\frac{y}{r}$, and rearranging gives us $y=r\sin\theta$.

## $r^2=x^2+y^2$

- We can rewrite this one to $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ if absolutely required.

## $\tan\theta=\frac yx$

- We can rearrange this as either of:
  - $y=x\tan\theta$
  - $x=\frac y{\tan\theta}$
  - $\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac yx\right)=\arctan\left(\frac yx\right)$
