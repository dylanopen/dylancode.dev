title: Bandwidth
---

The *bandwidth* is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a
communication channel in a given amount of time, usually in a second.

You can kind of think of it like a water pipe: the wider the pipe, the more water can flow through it in a given amount of time. Similarly, the higher the bandwidth of a communication channel, the more data can be transmitted through it in a given amount of time.

## Units

Bandwidth is generally measured in bits per second, but its actual units are
hertz (Hz), which is the number of signal changes per second. The reason for =
this is that the bandwidth of a communication channel is determined by the range
of frequencies that it can transmit.

## Frequency range

The bandwidth of a communication channel is determined by the range of
frequencies that it can transmit. For example, if a communication channel can
transmit frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, then its bandwidth is 20 kHz - 20
Hz = 19.98 kHz.

## Definition

> Bandwidth = a measure of the maximum capacity of a given communications
> channel

## Bandwidth vs bit rate

The bandwidth of a communication channel is the maximum amount of data that can
be transmitted over it in a given amount of time, while the bit rate is the
actual amount of data that is being transmitted over the channel in a given
amount of time.

Think of it like a motorway:
- The bandwidth is the speed limit of the motorway, which is the maximum speed
  that cars can travel on it.
- The bit rate is the actual speed of the cars on the motorway, which can be
  lower than the speed limit if there is traffic, or if the cars are not
  driving at the maximum speed, or various other things.
