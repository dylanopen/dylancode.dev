title: Arithmetic sequences
---

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

That means that each term is $n$ more than the last term.

For example, the sequence:

$$
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots
$$

is an arithmetic sequence where each term is 3 more than the previous term.

The constant difference between the terms is called the "common difference".

## Form of an arithmetic sequence

Arithmetic sequences can be written in the form:

$$
an+b
$$

Where:
- $a$ is the common difference
- $b$ is the first term minus the common difference

This form is known as the "nth term" of the sequence.

## Finding the nth term

To find the nth term of a sequence, we need to find two things:
- The common difference ($a$)
- The first term ($b$)

Once we've found these, just substitute $a$ and $b$ into the formula $an+b$!

## Finding the common difference

To find the common difference, simply subtract any term from the term after
it.

For example, in the sequence:

$$
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, \ldots
$$

The common difference is $4$, because, for example, $7 - 3 = 4$.

## Finding the offset

The offset ($b$) can be found by subtracting the common difference from the
first term.

For example, in the sequence:

$$
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, \ldots
$$

The common difference is $4$, and the first term is $3$, so the offset is:

$$
3 - 4 = -1
$$

## Examples

### Find the nth term of the sequence $5, 10, 15, 20, \ldots$

1. Find the common difference:
   $10 - 5 = 5$
2. Find the offset:
   $5 - 5 = 0$
3. Substitute into the formula:
   $5n + 0 = 5n$
4. **Answer**: $5n$.

### Find the nth term of the sequence $8, 12, 16, 20, \ldots$

1. Find the common difference:
   $12 - 8 = 4$
2. Find the offset:
   $8 - 4 = 4$
3. Substitute into the formula:
   $4n + 4$
4. **Answer**: $4n + 4$.

### Find the 17th term of the sequence with nth term $3n + 2$

1. Substitute $n = 17$:
   $3(17) + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53$
2. **Answer**: The 17th term is $53$.

### Find the 10th term of the sequence $2, 6, 10, 14, \ldots$

1. Find the common difference:
   $6 - 2 = 4$
2. Find the offset:
   $2 - 4 = -2$
3. Substitute into the formula:
   $4n - 2$
4. We now know the nth term is $4n - 2$.
5. Substitute $n = 10$:
   $4(10) - 2 = 40 - 2 = 38$
6. **Answer**: The 10th term is $38$.

### Find the 15th term of the sequence $7, 14, 21, 28, \ldots$

1. Find the common difference:
   $14 - 7 = 7$
2. Find the offset:
   $7 - 7 = 0$
3. Substitute into the formula:
   $7n + 0 = 7n$
4. We now know the nth term is $7n$.
5. Substitute $n = 15$:
   $7(15) = 105$
6. **Answer**: The 15th term is $105$.

### What is the common difference of the sequence with nth term $6n + 3$?

- The common difference is the coefficient of $n$.
- **Answer**: $6$.
