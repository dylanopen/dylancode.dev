> The **dimensions** of a matrix are the number of rows and columns it has.

## Dimensions of a matrix

We write the dimensions of a matrix as $m \times n$, where $m$ is the number of
rows and $n$ is the number of columns.

For example, this matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns, so its dimensions are
$2 \times 3$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Dimensions of a row vector

A *row* vector only has one, well, row. So a row vector with 4 columns has
dimensions $1 \times 4$.

A row vector might look something like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Dimensions of a column vector

A *column* vector only has one column. So that means that a column vector with
3 rows has dimensions $3 \times 1$.

Column vectors look like this, for example:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Dimensions of a square matrix

If we have a *square* matrix, it has the same number of rows and columns. So a
square matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns has dimensions $4 \times 4$.

A square matrix might look like this, a $4 \times 4$ matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
13 & 14 & 15 & 16
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Or, like this, a $2 \times 2$ matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
