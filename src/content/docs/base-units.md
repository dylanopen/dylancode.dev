title: Base units
---

There are seven base 'SI' units. They are:

- Meter (m) - for length
- Kilogram (kg) - for mass
- Second (s) - for time
- Ampere (A) - for electric current
- Kelvin (K) - for temperature
- Mole (mol) - for amount of substance
- Candela (cd) - for light intensity

(You probably don't need to worry about candelas!)
