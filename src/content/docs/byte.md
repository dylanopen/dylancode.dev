title: Byte

A byte is simply **8 [bits](/bit)**.

It's a term we use to make it easier to talk about larger amounts of data.

## Number of values represented by bytes

> A byte can represent 256 different values.

This is because a byte is made up of 8 bits, and each bit can be in one of two
states (0 or 1). Therefore, the total number of combinations of 8 bits is:

$$
2^8 = 256
$$
