title: Graph loop
---

A loop is where a [vertex](/graph-vertex) on a [graph](/graph) has an
[edge](/graph-edge) that connects back to itself. In other words, the edge
starts and ends at the same vertex.

> A loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.

## Loops and vertex degrees

- If a vertex has a loop, its [degree](/graph-vertex-degree) increases by 2,
  since the loop technically attaches to the vertex twice (once at each end).
- This only applies if the graph is *not* [directed](/directed-graph).

## Simple graphs

- A [simple graph](/simple-graph) is a graph that does not allow loops or
  multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
- This means that loops can't exist in simple graphs.
