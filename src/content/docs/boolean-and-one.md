title: Boolean AND one
---

If we have an expression like:

$$
A\cdot 1
$$

...then for any value of $A$, we are ANDing it with one. If we and anything with
1, then we just get back the value $A$.

We know that, because of the `AND` truth table:
- `1 AND 1 = 1`
- `0 AND 1 = 0`, so:
- `A AND 1 = A`

In short:

$$
A\cdot1=A
$$

We can use this to [simplify boolean algebra](/simplifying-boolean-algebra)!
