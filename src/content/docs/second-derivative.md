title: Second derivative
---

The *second derivative* of a function or polynomial is simply the derivative of
its first derivative.

In other words, we differentiate it **twice**!

## Notation

As mentioned in [derivative notation](/derivative-notation), the second
derivative of a *function* $f(x)$ can be written as:

$$
f''(x)
$$

If we just have a polynomial $y$ (in terms of $x$) then the second derivative is
written as:

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$

> Notice the position of the squares!

## Finding the second derivative

To find the second derivative we just differentiate it... and then differentiate
it again!

It's the derivative of the derivative.

### Find the second derivative of $f(x)=x^3+2x^2+x$

- First, we find the first derivative:
  - $f'(x)=3x^{3-1} + 2\times2x^{2-1} + 1x^{1-1}$
  - $=3x^2 + 4x + 1$
- Now we differentiate it again to find the second derivative:
  - $f''(x)=2\times3x^{2-1} + 1\times4x^{1-1} + 0$
  - $=6x + 4$
- **Answer**: $f''(x)=6x + 4$

### $f'(x)=4x^3 - 2x + 7$. Find $f''(x)$.

- We differentiate $f'(x)$ (the first derivative) to find the second derivative:
  - $f''(x)=3\times4x^{3-1} - 1\times2x^{1-1} + 0$
  - $=12x^2 - 2$
- **Answer**: $f''(x)=12x^2 - 2$

### Find the second derivative of $y=5x^4 - 3x^2 + x - 8$.

- First, we find the first derivative:
  - $\frac{dy}{dx}=4\times5x^{4-1} - 2\times3x^{2-1} + 1 - 0$
  - $=20x^3 - 6x + 1$
- Now we differentiate it again to find the second derivative:
  - $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=3\times20x^{3-1} - 1\times6x^{1-1} + 0$
  - $=60x^2 - 6$
- **Answer**: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=60x^2 - 6$

### $\frac{dy}{dx}=7x^5 + 4x^2 - x + 3$. Find $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$.

- We differentiate $\frac{dy}{dx}$ (the first derivative) to find the second derivative:
  - $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=5\times7x^{5-1} + 2\times4x^{2-1} - 1 + 0$
  - $=35x^4 + 8x - 1$
- **Answer**: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=35x^4 + 8x - 1$
