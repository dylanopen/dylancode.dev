title: Inequality signs
---

There are four main inequality signs you need to know about:

- $<$ : less than
- $>$ : greater than
- $\leq$ : less than or equal to
- $\geq$ : greater than or equal to

## Less than

The $<$ symbol means that the value/expression on the left is **less than**
the value/expression on the right.

### Example: $x < 5$

This means that $3$ is less than $5$.

## Greater than

The $>$ symbol means that the value/expression on the left is **greater than**
the value/expression on the right.

### Example: $y > 2$

This means that $y$ is greater than $2$.

## Less than or equal to

The $\leq$ symbol means that the value/expression on the left is **less than or
equal to** the value/expression on the right.

### Example: $a \leq 10$

This means that $a$ is either less than $10$ or equal to $10$.

## Greater than or equal to

The $\geq$ symbol means that the value/expression on the left is **greater than
or equal to** the value/expression on the right.

### Example: $b \geq 7$

This means that $b$ is either greater than $7$ or equal to $7$.
