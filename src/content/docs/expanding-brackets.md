title: Expanding brackets
---

A key part of GCSE maths is being able to expand brackets. This is when we have
an expression, for example, $5(4x+3)$, and we want to 'remove' the brackets by
multiplying out the terms inside the brackets.

> You may also hear this as **multiplying polynomials**. Polynomials are just
> expressions with multiple terms, like $4x + 3$ or $x^2 - 2x + 1$, and they're
> being multiplied together when we expand brackets.

## The grid method

The most visual way to expand brackets is to use the *grid method*. This is
where we draw a grid to help us multiply each term inside the brackets by the
term(s) outside the brackets.
