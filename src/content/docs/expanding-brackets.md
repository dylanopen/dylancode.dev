title: Expanding brackets
---

A key part of GCSE maths is being able to expand brackets. This is when we have
an expression, for example, $5(4x+3)$, and we want to 'remove' the brackets by
multiplying out the terms inside the brackets.

## The grid method

The most visual way to expand brackets is to use the *grid method*. This is
where we draw a grid to help us multiply each term inside the brackets by the
term(s) outside the brackets.

### Example: Expand $3(2x + 5)$ using the grid method

Draw a grid with one row and two columns, since we have one term outside the
brackets ($3$) and two terms inside the brackets ($2x$ and $5$):

| $\times$ | $2x$ | $2x$ |
|----------|------|------|
| $3$      |      |      |

Although it's not necessary to write the multiplication sign in the top-left
it can help remind us that we are multiplying each row term by each column term.

Now, multiply each term inside the brackets by the term outside the brackets:

| $\times$ | $2x$    | $5$     |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $3$      | $6x$    | $15$    |

Add the terms in the middle of the grid together to get the final answer:
- Answer: $6x + 15$

### Example: Expand $(x - 4)(x - 2)$ using the grid method

Draw a grid with two rows and two columns, since we have two terms in each
set of brackets:

| $\times$ | $x$     | $-2$    |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $x$      |         |         |
| $-4$     |         |         |

Now, multiply each term in the first set of brackets by each term in the
second set of brackets (with the grid method, this is as simple as filling in
each box by multiplying the row and column headers):

| $\times$ | $x$     | $-2$    |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $x$      | $x^2$   | $-2x$   |
| $-4$     | $-4x$   | $8$     |

> Remember: The $-2$ and $-4$ headers multiply to give ***positive*** $8$,

Add the terms in the middle of the grid together to get the final answer:
- $x^2-4x-2x+8$
- Answer: $x^2 - 6x + 8$
