title: Converting decimals to fractions
---

Because we work with base 10 (decimal) numbers, it's very easy for us to
convert decimals to fractions *where the denominator is a power of 10*.

For example, we know that 0.1 is the same as 1/10, because the 1 is in the
tenths place. Similarly, 0.72 is the same as 72/100, because the 2 is in the
hundredths place and the 7 is in the tenths place.

> This only works for *terminating* decimals, which are decimals that come to
  an end. See [converting recurring decimals to fractions](/converting-recurring-decimals-to-fractions)
  for a method to convert *recurring* decimals to fractions.

## Simplifying

Once we've found the decimal as a fraction of a power of 10, we need to simplify
it.

To do this, we first need to find the [highest common factor](/highest-common-factor).
See the link to learn how to find the HCF.

## Example conversions

### Convert $0.5$ to a fraction

- The 5 is in the tenths place, so we can write it as $\frac{5}{10}$.
- Simplify:
  - The HCF of $5$ and $10$ is $5$.
  - $\frac{5 \div 5}{10 \div 5} = \frac{1}{2}$.
- **Answer:** $0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$.

### Convert $0.75$ to a fraction

- The 7 is in the tenths place and the 5 is in the hundredths place, so we can
  write it as $\frac{75}{100}$.
- Simplify:
  - The HCF of $75$ and $100$ is $25$.
  - $\frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4}$.
- **Answer:** $0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$.

### Convert $0.32$ to a fraction

- The 3 is in the tenths place and the 2 is in the hundredths place, so we can
  write it as $\frac{32}{100}$.
- Simplify:
  - The HCF of $32$ and $100$ is $4$.
  - $\frac{32 \div 4}{100 \div 4} = \frac{8}{25}$.
- **Answer:** $0.32 = \frac{8}{25}$.

### Convert $7.125$ to a fraction

- The 7 is in the units place, so we start with 7.
- The 1 is in the tenths place, the 2 is in the hundredths place, and the 5 is
  in the thousandths place, so we can write it as $\frac{7125}{1000}$.
- Simplify:
  - The HCF of $7125$ and $1000$ is $125$.
  - $\frac{7125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{57}{8}$.
- **Answer:** $7.125 = \frac{57}{8}$.

### Convert $0.04$ to a fraction

- The 4 is in the hundredths place, so we can write it as $\frac{4}{100}$.
- Simplify:
  - The HCF of $4$ and $100$ is $4$.
  - $\frac{4 \div 4}{100 \div 4} = \frac{1}{25}$.
- **Answer:** $0.04 = \frac{1}{25}$.
