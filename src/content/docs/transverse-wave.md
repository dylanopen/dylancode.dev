title: Transverse wave
---

Transverse waves are a type of wave where the *direction of the oscillations*
(vibrations) is **perpendicular** to the *direction of energy transfer*.

This is sometimes said to be 'up and down'. In reality, it is in *any direction*
that is at a right angle to the way the wave is travelling, or the direction the
energy is being transferred.

## Examples of transverse waves

- Light waves
- Other electromagnetic waves
- Water ripple waves
