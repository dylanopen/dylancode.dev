title: Singular matrix
---

A matrix is called *singular* if its determinant is equal to zero. For example,
the matrix $N=\begin{matrix} 2 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 \end{matrix}$ is singular, because
its determinant is $2\cdot 2 - 4 \cdot 1 = 0$.

This is useful when:
- finding inverse matrices
- finding transformations

### Find $p$ for the singular matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & p+2 \\ -1 & 3-p \end{bmatrix}$

- Singular matrices have a determinant of $0$.
- Determinant = $ad-bc$
- $a=4$, $b=p+2$, $c=-1$ and $d=3-p$.
- $0 = 4(3-p) - (p+2)(-1)$
- $0 = 12 - 4p + p + 2$
- $0 = 14 - 3p$
- $3p = 14$
- $p = \frac{14}{3}$

## Inverse matrix

> A singular matrix does not have an inverse matrix.
