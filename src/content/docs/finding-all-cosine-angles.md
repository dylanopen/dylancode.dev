title: Finding all cosine angles
---

## Cosine rule

$$
\cos(360-\theta)=\cos\theta
$$

This means that, if we know one solution for $\theta$, we can find another by
subtracting that angle from $360\degree$.

## Negative cosine angles

$$
\cos(-\theta)=\cos\theta
$$

> The cosine of a negative angle is the negative of the cosine of the positive
> angle

## Periodicity of cosine

The cosine function has a period of $360\degree$. This means that every interval
of $360\degree$, the cosine function repeats its values.

This means that we can add or subtract $360\degree$ any number of times to find
more solutions to cosine equations:

$$
\cos\theta=\cos(\theta+360n)
$$

... where $n$ is any integer.

## Solving cosine equations

### Solve $cos\theta=0.5$ for values of $\theta$ between $0\degree$ and $720\degree$.

- $\cos^{-1}(0.5)=60\degree$
- $360\degree-60\degree=300\degree$
- $60\degree+360\degree=420\degree$
- $300\degree+360\degree=660\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=60\degree,300\degree,420\degree,660\degree$

### Solve $cos\theta=-0.5$ for values of $\theta$ between $-360\degree$ and $360\degree$.

- $\cos^{-1}(-0.5)=120\degree$
- $360\degree-120\degree=240\degree$
- $120\degree-360\degree=-240\degree$
- $240\degree-360\degree=-120\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=-240\degree,-120\degree,120\degree,240\degree$

### Solve $cos\theta=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ for values of $\theta$ between $0\degree$ and $360\degree$.

- $\cos^{-1}(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})=45\degree$
- $360\degree-45\degree=315\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=45\degree,315\degree$
