title: Resistance in a wire
---

Resistance in a wire is caused by the positive metal ions in the metal blocking
the flow of electrons.

The type of material determines the resistance (but so do other things like the
length and thickness of the wire).

Resistance is inversely proportional to the current (if the potential
difference is constant). This means that as resistance increases, current
decreases.

Resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference (if the current
is constant). This means that as resistance increases, potential difference
increases.

## Factors affecting resistance

- Area of cross-section (thickness)
  - Thicker wires have less resistance
  - That's because there is more space for the electrons to flow through
    without colliding with the metal ions
- Length of wire
  - Longer wires have more resistance
- Temperature
  - Higher temperatures increase resistance
  - That's because, at higher temperatures, the metal ions vibrate more so
    collide with the electrons more frequently
- Material
  - Some materials have more resistance than others
  - This is called the material's [resistivity](/resistivity)
