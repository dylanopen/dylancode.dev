title: Displacement
---

*Displacement* measures how far we are from our starting position.

Importantly, we measure it in a certain direction, so it's a
[vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

## Example

- Let's suppose we walk 1km north, then 2km back.
- THe total *distance* we travelled is 3km.
- But our displacement is 1km south: because that's how much our current
  position has *changed*.

## $\text{displacement}=\text{velocity}\times\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the displacement, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the velocity, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$
