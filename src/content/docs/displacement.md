title: Displacement
---

*Displacement* measures how far we are from our starting position.

Importantly, we measure it in a certain direction, so it's a
[vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

## Example

- Let's suppose we walk 1km north, then 2km back.
- THe total *distance* we travelled is 3km.
- But our displacement is 1km south: because that's how much our current
  position has *changed*.

## $\text{displacement}=\text{velocity}\times\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the displacement, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the velocity, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$

### A lorry travels at a velocity of $20ms^{-1}$ for 10s. Calculate the displacement.

- $s=vt$
- $s=20\times10=200$
- Answer: $200m$

### A car travels at a velocity of $15ms^{-1}$ for 5s. Calculate the displacement.

- $s=vt$
- $s=15\times5=75$
- Answer: $75m$

### A bike travels at a velocity of $0.5ms^{-1}$ for 20s. Calculate the displacement.

- $s=vt$
- $s=0.5\times20=10$
- Answer: $10m$

### A car travels at a velocity of $30ms^{-1}$ for 8s. Calculatethe displacement.

- $s=vt$
- $s=30\times8=240$- Answer: $240m$

### A lorry travels at a velocity of $25ms^{-1}$ for 12s. Calculate the displacement.

- $s=vt$
- $s=25\times12=300$
- Answer: $300m$
