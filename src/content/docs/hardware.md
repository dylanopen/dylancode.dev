The [software](/software) is executed *by* the hardware. For example:
- the CPU decodes and runs the instructions in our programs
- it stores and fetches data from RAM
- it reads and writes data to storage devices
- it sends output to the monitor
- it receives input from peripherals like the keyboard and mouse
- it communicates with other computers over the network via the NIC
