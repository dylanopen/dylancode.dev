title: Sine-cosine offset identity
---

As well as the identity that $\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta\equiv1$, there is
another identity linking the $\sin$ function with the $\cos$ function:

$$
\cos x\equiv\sin(x+90)
$$

And, similarly, we can find that:

$$
\sin x\equiv\cos(x-90)
$$

## Other derivatives

- $\sin x\equiv\cos(90-x)\equiv\cos(x-90)$
- $\cos x\equiv\sin(90-x)\equiv\sin(x+90)$
- $\cos x=\sin(x+90)$
- $\sin x=\cos(x-90)$
