title: Speed
---

*Speed* measures how much the *distance* changes, every second.

It's not in any specific direction, so it's a [scalar quantity](/scalar-quantity).

## Example

- We cycle 18km in 1 hour, so hour *speed* is:
  - $18km\div1h=18hmh^{-1}$
- Or, if we walk $400m$ in $200s$, our speed is:
  - $400m\div200s=2ms^{-1}$

## $\text{speed}=\text{distance}\div\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

$$
v=\frac st
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the distance, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the speed, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$
