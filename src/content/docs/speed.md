title: Speed
---

*Speed* measures how much the *distance* changes, every second.

It's not in any specific direction, so it's a [scalar quantity](/scalar-quantity).

## Example

- We cycle 18km in 1 hour, so our *speed* is:
  - $18km\div1h=18hmh^{-1}$
- Or, if we walk $400m$ in $200s$, our speed is:
  - $400m\div200s=2ms^{-1}$

## $\text{speed}=\text{distance}\div\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

$$
v=\frac st
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the distance, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the speed, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$

### A van drives 200m in 10s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{200}{10}=20$
- Answer: $20ms^{-1}$ 
### A car drives 75m in 5s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{75}{5}=15$
- Answer: $15ms^{-1}$ 
### A bike drives 10m in 20s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{10}{20}=0.5$
- Answer: $0.5ms^{-1}$

### A truck drives 240m in 8s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{240}{8}=30$
- Answer: $30ms^{-1}$ 

### A car drives 300m in 12s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{300}{12}=25$
- Answer: $25ms^{-1}$ 

### A van drives 600m in 15s. Calculate the speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{600}{15}=40$
- Answer: $40ms^{-1}$ 

### A person cycles 100km in 4h. Calculate their average speed.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{100}{4}=25$
- Answer: $25kmh^{-1}$
