We can simplify ratios in the same way that we can simplify fractions.

## How to simplify ratios

1. Find the [highest common factor (HCF)](/highest-common-factor) of all the
   parts of the ratio.
2. Divide each part of the ratio by the HCF.
3. Write the new ratio.

### Simplify $12:16$

- The HCF of $12$ and $16$ is $4$.
- We divide both parts of the ratio by $4$:
  - $12 \div 4 = 3$
  - $16 \div 4 = 4$
- So, the simplified ratio is $3:4$.

### Simplify $18:24:30$

- The HCF of $18$, $24$ and $30$ is $6$.
- We divide each part of the ratio by $6$:
  - $18 \div 6 = 3$
  - $24 \div 6 = 4$
  - $30 \div 6 = 5$
- So, the simplified ratio is $3:4:5$.

### Simplify $45:60$

- The HCF of $45$ and $60$ is $15$.
- We divide both parts of the ratio by $15$:
  - $45 \div 15 = 3$
  - $60 \div 15 = 4$
- So, the simplified ratio is $3:4$.

### Simplify $100x:250x^2:400x$

- The HCF of $100x$, $250x^2$ and $400x$ is $50x$.
- We divide each part of the ratio by $50x$:
  - $100x \div 50x = 2$
  - $250x^2 \div 50x = 5x$
  - $400x \div 50x = 8$
- So, the simplified ratio is $2:5x:8$.
