title: Operating system role
---

The role of an operating system is to provide a bridge between the computer
hardware and the software applications that run on it.

## The role for software developers

It provides lots of *abstractions* so that the software developers don't have to
worry about the low-level details of the hardware.

For example, instead of having to directly manage the CPU, memory, storage
devices, and peripherals, the operating system provides a set of APIs and
services that the software can use to interact with the hardware in a more
convenient way.

You can think of the operating system as a kind of *middleman* that sits
between the hardware and the software, managing resources and providing an
interface for the software to use.

## The role for end-users

You probably think of your operating system as the thing that provides the user
interface to your computer - the desktop environment, the file manager, the
taskbar, and so on.

It's not really clearly defined where the operating system ends and the
*application software* begins, since many operating systems come with a whole
suite of applications pre-installed (like web browsers, file explorers, media
players, and so on).

For example, 'Linux' itself is just an operating system [kernel](/kernel). If
you used raw Linux without a *distro*, you'd just be using a kernel with
everything else as extra, [application software](/application-software).  
But most people run a *distribution* of Linux (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and
so on) which bundles the Linux kernel with a whole bunch of other software to
make it usable. The entire package is often referred to as an 'operating system'
\- whether the kernel itself is also an operating system is up to you to decide
:)
