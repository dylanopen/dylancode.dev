title: Constructive interference
---

When two waves meet which are [*in phase*](/wave-phase-difference), their
amplitudes add together to create a wave with a larger amplitude. That's
called *constructive interference*.

If the phase difference between the two waves is zero or a multiple of
360°, the waves are in phase. That means that the peaks of one wave line up
exactly with the peaks of the other wave, and the troughs line up exactly
with the troughs. When this happens, the amplitudes of the two waves add
together to create a new wave with a larger amplitude.

For example, if two waves each have an amplitude of 2 units, when they
interfere, they will interfere constructively to create a new wave with an
amplitude of 4 units.
