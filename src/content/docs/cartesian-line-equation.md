title: Cartesian line equation
---

The *cartesian* form of a **2D** line is the form you are used to seeing.

It describes how the $y$ value changes as $x$ changes (with an offset, $c$):

$$
y=mx+c
$$

## Why Cartesian form works

This equation is true, because any $(x,y)$ point along the line will satisfy
the equation.

For example, take the line equation $y=4x+3$, which, drawing the graph, we
can see has a point at, for example, $(2, 11)$:
- Substitute the values into the equation:
  - $11=4(2)+3$
  - $11=8+3$
  - $11=11$ // true

> While this may seem obvious, it shows us something very important:
> - A line equation simply represents a 'condition' where, when a point is
>   substituted into the line equation, the point is only on the line if the
>   equation is satisfied (true).

## Different form 2D line equations

You may have also seen an equation that looks like this:

$$
x=7
$$

*All* that this means is that, for any point, it is on the line **if** its
x-coordinate is equal to 7. That means that we will get a straight
*vertical* line, where the x-coordinate of all the points on the line is
$7$.

## 3D cartesian line equations

We don't usually work with 3D lines in their Cartesian format (we usually
[convert them to vector form](/converting-cartesian-to-vector-line)) - but
we can do.

The same rule applies as with 2D lines - the equation of a line simply
defines the conditions that a point must satisfy to be on the line.

### Example: line where $x=5$ and $z=-2$

For the line with that equation, it essentially means that *every* point on
the line has $x$ coordinate $5$ and $z$ coordinate of $-2$, **but** the $y$
coordinate could be anything.
