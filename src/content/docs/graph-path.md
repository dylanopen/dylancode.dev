title: Graph path
---

A **path** is just like a [walk](/graph-walk) on a [graph](/graph), except that
you are not allowed to traverse the same [edge](/graph-edge) **or**
[vertex](/graph-vertex) more than once.

## Visiting vertices and edges

- You **cannot** visit the same [vertex](/graph-vertex) multiple times in a
  path.
- You also **cannot** visit the same [edge](/graph-edge) multiple times in a
  path.
