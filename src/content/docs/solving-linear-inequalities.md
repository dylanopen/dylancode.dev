title: Solving linear inequalities

Linear inequalities are similar to linear equations, but instead of an equals
sign (=), they use inequality signs.

## Solving linear inequalities

Solving linear inequalities is very similar to solving linear equations. The
main difference is that when we multiply or divide both sides of the inequality
by a negative number, we need to reverse the direction of the inequality sign.

### Example: Solve the inequality $3x + 5 < 14$

- Subtract $5$ from both sides:
  - $3x + 5 - 5 < 14 - 5$
  - $3x < 9$
- Divide both sides by $3$:
  - $\frac{3x}{3} < \frac{9}{3}$
  - $x < 3$

**Answer**: $x < 3$

### Example: Solve the inequality $-2x + 4 \geq 10$

- Subtract $4$ from both sides:
  - $-2x + 4 - 4 \geq 10 - 4$
  - $-2x \geq 6$
- Divide both sides by $-2$ (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
  - $\frac{-2x}{-2} \leq \frac{6}{-2}$
  - $x \leq -3$

**Answer**: $x \leq -3$

### Example: Solve the inequality $5x - 7 > 3x + 1$

- Subtract $3x$ from both sides:
  - $5x - 3x - 7 > 3x - 3x + 1$
  - $2x - 7 > 1$
- Add $7$ to both sides:
  - $2x - 7 + 7 > 1 + 7$
  - $2x > 8$
- Divide both sides by $2$:
  - $\frac{2x}{2} > \frac{8}{2}$
  - $x > 4$

**Answer**: $x > 4$
