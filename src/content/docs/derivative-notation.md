We have a few options for writing the derivative of a function or expresssion.

## Writing the derivative of a function

Let's say we have a function $f(x)$ and we differentiate it. How do we write
the derivative?

Because $f(x)$ is a function, we can write this as:

$$
f'(x)
$$

Notice the apostrophe after the $f$. That indicates the derivative.

## Writing the derivative of an expression

If we instead have an expression, like $x^2 + 3x + 2$, we can write the
derivative in a different way:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}(x^2 + 3x + 2)
$$

$\frac{dy}{dx}$ indicates 'the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$'.
Basically, we're saying 'how does $y$ change as $x$ changes?'.

## Higher-order derivatives

### Higher-order derivatives of a function

If we want to write, for example, the *second* derivative of a function $g(x)$,
we can use double apostrophes (one for each order of derivative):

$$
g''(x)
$$

Similarly, the *third* derivative would be:

$$
g'''(x)
$$

... and so on.

### Higher-order derivatives of an expression

For expressions, it's a little more that we need to do, but nothing complicated.
The *second* derivative, for example, of an expression for $y$ with respect to
$x$ is written as:

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$

The *third* derivative would be:

$$
\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}
$$

... and again, the pattern repeats (just increase the power for each order of
derivative).
