title: Random error
---

A *random error* is an error in a measurement that makes the measured values
less accurate.

They can be caused by:
- Unexpected Environmental changes (e.g. temperature, humidity, vibrations)
- Limitations of the measuring instrument (e.g. precision limits)
- Human error (e.g. slightly misreading the instrument)
- Other unpredictable factors

## How much do random errors affect measurements?

It entirely depends on *how well* the person doing the experiment is able to
use the apparatus, and how well the apparatus is able to measure.

For example, if you're measuring the length of a table with a ruler that has
millimetre markings, you might be able to measure the length to within a few
millimetres. However, if you're using a tape measure that only has centimetre
markings, your measurement might only be accurate to within a centimetre or
two.

Or, if you get a new intern who failed physics at school to do the measurements,
they might not be the most accurate either... because the *random error* would
be higher.

## Reducing random errors

To reduce random errors, you can:
- Take multiple measurements and average them
- Use more precise measuring instruments
- make sure the measuring environment is stable (e.g. consistent temperature)
- Train the person doing the measurements to be more accurate
- Calibrate the measuring instruments regularly
- Use digital measuring instruments that reduce human reading errors
