title: Gravitational potential energy
---

When objects are above the ground, they have the *potential* to fall down to the
ground.

When they do fall, they transfer that *gravitational* potential energy into
[kinetic energy](/kinetic-energy) as they speed up.

## Calculating the change in gravitational potential energy

If we know the:
- mass of the object, in kilograms, $kg$
- height the object is lifted up by, in metres, $m$
- gravitational field strength, in newtons per kilogram, $N/kg$

...then we can calculate the *change* in gravitational potential energy when the
object is lifted up or falls down!

The formula we use is:

$$
\text{Change in gravitational potential energy} = \text{mass} \times \text{gravitational field strength} \times \text{change in height above ground}
$$

Putting it into symbols, we get:

$$
\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h
$$

Where:

- $\Delta E_p$ is the change in gravitational potential energy, in joules, $J$
- $m$ is the mass of the object, in kilograms, $kg$
- $g$ is the gravitational field strength, in newtons per kilogram, $N/kg$
- $\Delta h$ is the change in the object's distance from the ground, in metres,
  $m$

## Height

Make sure the height is the shortest distance from the object to the ground.

The height should be *perpendicular* to the gravitational field lines
(or parallel to the force of gravity).

## 'Change in'?

We can't directly calculate the gravitational potential energy of an object,
but we *can* calculate its *change* in gravitational potential energy when it
falls or is lifted up.

That's why we put the $\Delta$ symbol in front of $E_p$ and $h$ in the formula,
to show that we're calculating the *change* in gravitational potential energy
and height, not the actual gravitational potential energy or height.

If we were calculating the actual gravitational potential energy, that would
suggest that an object on the surface of the Earth has zero gravitational
potential energy, which isn't true - the surface of the Earth isn't the absolute
point where gravitational potential energy is zero, it's just the point where we
usually choose to measure it from.

## Examples

### A 2 kg object is lifted up by 5 m. The gravitational field strength is 10 N/kg. What is the change in gravitational potential energy of the object?

- $m = 2\,kg$
- $\Delta h = 5\,m$
- $g = 10\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $\Delta E_p = 2\,kg \times 10\,N/kg \times 5\,m$
- $\Delta E_p = 100\,J$

### The gravitational field strength on the Moon is 1.6 N/kg. A 3 kg object is lifted up by 4 m on the Moon. What is the change in gravitational potential energy of the object?

- $m = 3\,kg$
- $\Delta h = 4\,m$
- $g = 1.6\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $\Delta E_p = 3\,kg \times 1.6\,N/kg \times 4\,m$
- $\Delta E_p = 19.2\,J$

### An object gains 49 J of gravitational potential energy when it is lifted up by 10 m. The gravitational field strength is 9.8 N/kg. What is the mass of the object?

- $\Delta E_p = 49\,J$
- $\Delta h = 10\,m$
- $g = 9.8\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $m = \frac{\Delta E_p}{g\Delta h}$
- $m = \frac{49\,J}{9.8\,N/kg \times 10\,m}$
- $m = 0.5\,kg$

### An object loses 20 J of gravitational potential energy when it falls down by 2 m. The gravitational field strength is 10 N/kg. What is the mass of the object?

- $\Delta E_p = -20\,J$ (the object loses energy, so the change in energy is negative)
- $\Delta h = -2\,m$ (the object falls down, so the change in height is negative)
- $g = 10\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $m = \frac{\Delta E_p}{g\Delta h}$
- $m = \frac{-20\,J}{10\,N/kg \times -2\,m}$
- $m = 1\,kg$

### How far does a 2 kg object fall if it loses 80 J of gravitational potential energy? Assume the gravitational field strength is 10 N/kg.

- $m = 2\,kg$
- $\Delta E_p = -80\,J$ (the object loses energy, so the change in energy is negative)
- $g = 10\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $\Delta h = \frac{\Delta E_p}{mg}$
- $\Delta h = \frac{-80\,J}{2\,kg \times 10\,N/kg}$
- $\Delta h = -4\,m$
- So the object falls down by 4 m.

### A 5 kg object is lifted up on a far-away mega planet, where the gravitational field strength is 80 N/kg. The object gains 200 J of gravitational potential energy. How far is the object lifted up?

- $m = 5\,kg$
- $\Delta E_p = 200\,J$
- $g = 80\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $\Delta h = \frac{\Delta E_p}{mg}$
- $\Delta h = \frac{200\,J}{5\,kg \times 80\,N/kg}$
- $\Delta h = 0.5\,m$

### A 5 kg object is lifted up by 3 m on the Moon, where the gravitational field strength is 1.6 N/kg. How much gravitational potential energy does the object gain?

- $m = 5\,kg$
- $\Delta h = 3\,m$
- $g = 1.6\,N/kg$
- $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- $\Delta E_p = 5\,kg \times 1.6\,N/kg \times 3\,m$
- $\Delta E_p = 24\,J$
