title: Velocity
---

*Velocity* measures how much the *displacement* changes, every second.

It measures the rate of change of displacement in a *specific direction*, so it
is a [vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

## Example

- We walk 25km north in 5 hours, so to find our *velocity*:
  - displacement = $25km$ north
  - velocity = displacement / time
  - $v=25km\div5h=5kmh^{-1}$
- Or, if we walk $400m$ north then 500m south in $200s$, finding our velocity:
  - displacement = $400m-500m=100m$ south
  - $v=s\div t$
  - $v=100m\div200s=0.5ms^{-1}$ south

## $\text{velocity}=\text{displacement}\div\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

$$
v=\frac st
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the displacement, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the velocity, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$
