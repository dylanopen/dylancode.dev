title: Velocity
---

*Velocity* measures how much the *displacement* changes, every second.

It measures the rate of change of displacement in a *specific direction*, so it
is a [vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

## Example

- We walk 25km north in 5 hours, so to find our *velocity*:

- displacement = $25km$ north

- velocity = displacement / time

- $v=25km\div5h=5kmh^{-1}$
- Or, if we walk $400m$ north then 500m south in $200s$, finding our velocity:

- displacement = $400m-500m=100m$ south

- $v=s\div t$

- $v=100m\div200s=0.5ms^{-1}$ south

## $\text{velocity}=\text{displacement}\div\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

$$
v=\frac st
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the displacement, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the velocity, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$


### A van drives 200m in 10s. Calculate the velocity.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{200}{10}=20$
- Answer: $20ms^{-1}$

### A car drives 75m in 5s. Calculate the velocity.
- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{75}{5}=15$
- Answer: $15ms^{-1}$

### A car drives south 50m then north 150m, in 20s. Calculate the average velocity.
- displacement = $150m-50m=100m$ north
- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{100}{20}=5$
- Answer: $5ms^{-1}$ north

### A bike drives 10m in 20s. Calculate the velocity.
- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{10}{20}=0.5$
- Answer: $0.5ms^{-1}$

### A truck drives 240m in 8s. Calculate the velocity.
- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{240}{8}=30$
- Answer: $30ms^{-1}$

### A car drives 300m in 12s. Calculate the velocity.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{300}{12}=25$
- Answer: $25ms^{-1}$

### A van drives 600m in 15s. Calculate the velocity.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{600}{15}=40$
- Answer: $40ms^{-1}$


### A person cycles for 4h until reaching a destination 100km away. Calculate their average velocity.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{100}{4}=25$
- Answer: $25kmh^{-1}$

### A person cycles 100km north in 4h. Calculate their average velocity.

- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{100}{4}=25$
- Answer: $25kmh^{-1}$ north
