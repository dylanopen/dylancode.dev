title: Internal resistance
---

- Every component has *internal resistance*.
- $E$ is the *EMF* of the cell/battery.
- $V$ is the *potential difference* across the terminals.
- $r$ is the internal resistance of the cell/battery.

## Equation

$$
E=Ir+V = Ir + IR = I(r+R)
$$

## Example calculations

### If a battery has an internal resistance of $3\Omega$ and an EMF of $9V$, what is the current flowing and terminal p.d. when it's connected to a load of $12\Omega$?

- $r=3$
- $R=(12+3)=15$
- $E=9$
- $I=\frac9{15}$
- $V=0.6*12=7.2$

###

- $E=3$
- $V=2.8$
- $R=8$
- $I=2.8\div8=0.35$
