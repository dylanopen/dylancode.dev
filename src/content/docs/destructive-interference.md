title: Destructive interference
---

When two waves meet which are [*in antiphase*](/wave-phase-difference), their
amplitudes add together to create a wave with a *smaller* amplitude.

This is because, at that point, one wave has a positive displacement, while one
has a negative displacement - so they'll add to make a smaller amplitude.

Thsi is called *destructive interference*.

If the phase difference between the two waves is $\pi$ or a multiple of
$2\pi$ and offset by $\pi$, the waves are in phase. That means that the peaks of
one wave line up exactly with the **troughs** of the other wave, and the
troughs line up exactly with the **peaks**.

When this happens, if the waves are the same, they are in *antiphase* and
so the trough is the negative of the peak. That means they will add together to
make an amplitude of *zero* - they cancel out completely.
