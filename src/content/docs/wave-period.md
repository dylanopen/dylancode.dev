title: Wave period
---

The *period* of a wave is the **time** it takes for one complete wave to pass a
given point.

Essentially, it's another way of measuring how often waves pass a point (the
frequency), but instead of counting how many waves pass in one second, we
measure how long it takes for one wave to pass.

## Notation

We usually use the letter $T$ to represent the period of a wave.

Why? Because, uh... it's the first letter of "time". Sure.

## Units

The period is measured in **seconds** ($s$).

## Calculating period

The period can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Period} = \frac{1}{\text{Frequency}}
$$

Or, using symbols:

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$

Where:
- $T$ is the period (in seconds, $s$)
- $f$ is the [frequency](/wave-frequency) of the wave (in hertz, $Hz$)

This, of course, relies on us knowing the frequency of the wave. If we don't, we
can calculate it using the formulae covered in the
[wave-frequency](/wave-frequency) and [wave-speed](/wave-speed) chapters.

### Find the period of a wave with a frequency of 5 Hz.

- $T=\frac{1}{f}$ (write our formula)
- $T=\frac{1}{5}$ (substitute in the values)
- $T=0.2 s$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 0.2 seconds.

### Find the frequency of a wave with a period of 0.1 seconds.

- $T=\frac{1}{f}$ (write our formula)
- $f=\frac{1}{T}$ (rearrange it)
- $f=\frac{1}{0.1}$ (substitute in the values)
- $f=10 Hz$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 10 hertz.

### Find the frequency of a wave that takes 2 seconds for 4 complete waves to pass a point.

- $T=\frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of waves}}$ (write our formula)
- $T=\frac{2}{4}$ (substitute in the values)
- $T=0.5 s$ (calculate period)
- $f=\frac{1}{T}$ (write frequency formula)
- $f=\frac{1}{0.5}$ (substitute in the values)
- $f=2 Hz$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 2 hertz.

### Find the frequency of a wave that has a period of 25 milliseconds.

- $25 ms = 0.025 s$ (convert period to seconds)
- $f=\frac{1}{T}$ (write our formula)
- $f=\frac{1}{0.025}$ (substitute in the values)
- $f=40 Hz$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 40 hertz.

## Relationship with frequency

The period is *inversely proportional* to the [frequency](/wave-frequency) of
the wave - that means that, as frequency increases, period decreases.

For example, a wave with a frequency of 2 Hz has a period of 0.5 seconds (1/2),
while a wave with a frequency of 4 Hz has a period of 0.25 seconds (1/4) - half.
