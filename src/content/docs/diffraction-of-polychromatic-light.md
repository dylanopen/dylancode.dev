title: Diffraction of polychromatic light
---

If we use light that's made up of multiple wavelengths (for example, white
light), we'll see a pattern of coloured fringes instead of just bright and dark
fringes.

## White light

The central fringe will be white, because all of the wavelengths will interfere
constructively at the centre.

The fringes on either side of the central fringe will be coloured, because the different wavelengths will interfere constructively at different points on the
screen.

### Colour of the fringes

Closer to the centre, the fringes will be *blue* and *violet*, because the
shorter wavelengths will interfere constructively closer to the centre.

Further away from the centre, the fringes will be *red* and *orange*, because
the opposite (longer wavelengths will interfere constructively further away from
the centre).
