## What does $\sum^n_{r=1} r^2$ mean?

- We start our $r$ 'counter' at $1$
- Each time, we increase $r$ by $1$ until we reach $n$
- For each value of $r$, we calculate $r^2$
- Finally, we add all those $r^2$ values together.

> That's what the $\sum$ symbol means!

## Write $\frac12+\frac13+\frac14+\frac15+\frac16$ using sigma notation

$$
\sum^5_{r=1} \frac{1}{r+1}
$$

## Write $\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac1{16}+\frac1{32}$ using sigma notation

$$
\sum^5_{r=1} \frac{1}{2^r}
$$
