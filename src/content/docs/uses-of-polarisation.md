## Uses of polarisation

There are a few different uses of polarisation in real life:
- Reducing glare from surfaces
- Improving contrast in LCD screens
- Reducing reflections in photography
- Polarised sunglasses
- (among many other things)

## Reducing glare from surfaces

When light reflects off a flat surface (like water or a road), it becomes
partially polarised. This means that the reflected light waves oscillate more in
one direction than in others, which can create glare that makes it hard to see.

You can see this when looking at a wet road on a sunny day, or the surface of
the ocean. If you're standing at the right angle, the reflected light can be
very bright and make it difficult to see anything else.

To reduce this glare, we can use polarising filters (like those in polarised
sunglasses). These filters only allow light waves oscillating in a certain
direction to pass through, blocking the rest. By aligning the filter to block
the direction of the polarised reflected light, we can really reduce
the glare and improve visibility.

## Improving contrast in LCD screens

LCD screens are the most common type of screen you'll see. Unless you have an
OLED device, it's probably an LCD screen.

They work by having a *backlight* that produces unpolarised light, to light up
the different coloured pixels on the next layer of the screen.  
This light then passes through polarising filters that stop certain directions
of oscillation, allowing only light oscillating in a specific direction to
pass through.

This helps improve the contrast of the screen, which helps with things like
colour accuracy and viewing angles.

## Polarised sunglasses

Polarised sunglasses are a type of sunglasses that have polarising filters
built into them. This essentially makes them really good at reducing glare from
surfaces like water, roads, and snow.

Only the light that you want to see (the light oscillating in the right
direction) is allowed to pass through the lenses, while the rest is blocked.

This makes it much easier to see in bright conditions, and can also help
reduce *eye strain*.
