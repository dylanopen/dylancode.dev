Natural numbers are positive integers, starting from $1$ (not $0$). They're used
for counting *discrete* objects.

However, in computer science, natural numbers often include $0$ as well.

## Notation

The set of natural numbers is usually denoted by the symbol $\mathbb{N}$:

## Contained values

$$
\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots\}
$$

or:

$$
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots\}
$$

(0 may or may not be included, depending on the context.)
