There are some important laws of logarithms that are useful to know.
These can be derived from the [laws of indices](laws-of-indices).

These laws tell us how to:
- [add logarithms](/adding-logarithms)
- [subtract logarithms](/subtracting-logarithms)
- [multiply logarithms by a constant](/multiplying-logarithms-by-a-constant)
