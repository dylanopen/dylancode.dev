There are some important laws of logarithms that are useful to know.
These can be derived from the [laws of indices](laws-of-indices).

## Log of a product

$$
\log(xy)=\log x+\log y
$$

### Example: solve $\log_2(x+1)+\log_2(x-1)=3$

- $\log_2[(x+1)(x-1)]=3$
- $2^3=(x+1)(x-1)$
- $2^3=x^2-1$
- $x^2-1-2^3=0$
- $x^2-9=0$
- $(x+3)(x-3)$
- $x=3$ or $x=-3$
- **However** we cannot take the log of a negative number.
- So $x=3$

## Log of a quotient

$$
\log(\frac xy)=\log x-\log y
$$

## Log of a power

$$
\log(x^y)=y\log x
$$
