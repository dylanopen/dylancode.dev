A *rational number* is any number that can be written as a fraction of two
integers.

By definition, all rational numbers are also **real** numbers.

## Notation

The set of rational numbers is usually denoted by the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$:

$$
\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0 \right\}
$$

## Examples of rational numbers

- $\frac{1}{2}$
- $-3$ (can be written as $\frac{-3}{1}$)
- $0$ (can be written as $\frac{0}{1}$)
- $4.75$ (can be written as $\frac{19}{4}$)
- $-0.1$ (can be written as $\frac{-1}{10}$)
- $3.333\ldots$ (can be written as $\frac{10}{3}$)
- $7$ (can be written as $\frac{7}{1}$)

## Non-examples of rational numbers

- $\sqrt{2}$ (irrational)
- $\pi$ (irrational)
- $e$ (irrational)
- $i$ (not a *real* number)
