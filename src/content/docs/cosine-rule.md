title: Cosine rule
---

The cosine rule can be used to find:
- the length of a side of a triangle when we know the lengths of the other two
  sides and the angle between them
- or the angle between two sides of a triangle when we know the lengths of all
  three sides.

## The triangle

The lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$ represent the side lengths in this triangle.  
The angles $A$, $B$ and $C$ represent the angles in the triangle.

```
            A
          /   \
     c  /       \  b
      /           \
    /               \
   B ---------------- C
            a
```

## The cosine rule formula

Using the triangle above, the cosine rule tells us that:

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
$$

And, equivalently:

$$
\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
$$

## Example

### Find the length of side $a$

```
            75
          /    \
   8cm  /        \  5cm
      /            \
    /                \
   B ----------------- C
            a
```

- $b = 8$
- $c = 5$
- $A = 75^\circ$
- $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A$
- $a^2 = (8cm)^2 + (5cm)^2 - 2 \times 8cm \times 5cm \times \cos 75^\circ$
- $a^2 \approx 8.26cm$
