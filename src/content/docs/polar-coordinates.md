title: Polar coordinates
---

Like any other coordinate, a *polar* coordinate describes a position on a 
2D plane.

A polar coordinate is described by:
- the distance from the origin
- the *bearing* of the point from the origin

## Describing the bearing

We usually use *radians* to describe the bearing of a polar point from the
origin, but technically we could also use degrees.

The bearing starts from the line which extends from the origin to the *right*.  
On a cartesian system, this would be the 'positive X' line.

### Common bearings

Knowing that the bearing starts from the line extending to the right, we can
say that:
- The line going to the right from the origin is at a bearing of $0\pi$ radians
- The line going upwards from the origin is at a bearing of $\frac12\pi$ radians
- The line going to the left from the origin is at a bearing of $\pi$ radians
- The line going downwards from the origin is at a bearing of $\frac32\pi$
  radians

More simply in a table:

| Line      | Bearing (rad)    |
|-----------|------------------|
| Right     | $0$              |
| Top       | $\frac12\pi$     |
| Left      | $\pi$            |
| Bottom    | $\frac32\pi$     |

## Format of a polar coordinate

We write the polar coordinate in the form $(r,\theta)$, where:
- $r$ is the distance from the origin
- $\theta$ is the bearing of the point from the origin, measured in radians
  - It's usually between $0$ and $2\pi$
