title: Algebraic fractions

An algebraic fraction is simply a fraction which contains a variable in the
numerator, denominator, or both.

## Examples of algebraic fractions

- $\frac{x+2}{3}$
- $\frac{5}{y-4}$
- $\frac{2a+1}{b-3}$
- $\frac{m+1}{n-2} + \frac{3}{n-2}$
- $\frac{4x}{x^2 - 9}$

## Simplifying algebraic fractions

To simplify an algebraic fraction, we follow similar steps to simplifying
numerical fractions:

1. Find the [highest common factor (HCF)](/highest-common-factor) of the
   numerator and denominator.
2. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the HCF.
3. Write the simplified fraction.

## Examples

### Simplify $\frac{6x}{9}$

- The HCF of $6x$ and $9$ is $3$.
- Divide both the numerator and denominator by $3$:
  - $\frac{6x \div 3}{9 \div 3} = \frac{2x}{3}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{2x}{3}$

### Simplify $\frac{4y^2 + 8y}{12y}$

- The HCF of $4y^2 + 8y$ and $12y$ is $4y$.
- Divide both the numerator and denominator by $4y$:
  - $\frac{(4y^2 + 8y) \div 4y}{12y \div 4y} = \frac{y + 2}{3}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{y + 2}{3}$

### Simplify $\frac{3a^2 - 6a}{9a}$

- The HCF of $3a^2 - 6a$ and $9a$ is $3a$.
- Divide both the numerator and denominator by $3a$:
  - $\frac{(3a^2 - 6a) \div 3a}{9a \div 3a} = \frac{a - 2}{3}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{a - 2}{3}$

### Simplify $\frac{5x^2 + 10x}{15x}$

- The HCF of $5x^2 + 10x$ and $15x$ is $5x$.
- Divide both the numerator and denominator by $5x$:
  - $\frac{(5x^2 + 10x) \div 5x}{15x \div 5x} = \frac{x + 2}{3}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{x + 2}{3}$
