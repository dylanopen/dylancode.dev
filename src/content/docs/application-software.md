title: Application software
---

*Application software* includes any software which is designed for end-users who
are using the computer to perform a task.

Unlike [system software](/systems-software), which manages and operates the
computer hardware, application software doesn't interact directly with the
hardware. It instead relies on the system software (e.g. the operating system
and drivers) to handle that.

## Examples of application software

- Web browsers (like Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
- Word processors (like Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
- Spreadsheets (like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets)
- Media players (like VLC)
- Email clients (like Thunderbird)
- Games
- Design software
- Programming tools (like code editors, IDEs, compilers)
- (almost anything else you use on your computer!)
