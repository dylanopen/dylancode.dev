title: Factorising polynomials with complex roots

## Factor theorem

Using the factor theorem, we know that if $a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, one of the
factors of $f(x)$ is $x-a$. This also works for polynomials with complex roots.

If $a+bi$ is a root, that means that $(x-[a+bi])$, otherwise written as
$(x-a-bi)$, is a factor.

## Factorise $x^2-4x+40$ by first solving

- Let $x^2-4x+40=0$
- $(x-2)^2-4+40=0$
- $(x-2)^2=-36$
- $x-2=\sqrt{-36}$
- $x=2\pm6i$
- Roots: $x=2+6i$ or $x=2-6i$
- Factors (by the factor theorem): $[x-(2+6i)]$ and $[x-(2-6i)]$
