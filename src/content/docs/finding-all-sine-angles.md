title: Finding all sine angles
---

## Sine

$$
\sin(180-\theta)=\sin\theta
$$

This means that, if we know one solution for $\theta$, we can find another by
subtracting that angle from $180\degree$.

### Negative sine angles

$$
\sin(-\theta)=-\sin\theta
$$

> The sine of a negative angle is the negative of the sine of the positive angle

### Periodicity of sine

The sine function has a period of $360\degree$. This means that every interval
of $360\degree$, the sine function repeats its values. 

This means that we can add or subtract $360\degree$ any number of times to find
more solutions to sine equations:

$$
\sin\theta=\sin(\theta+360n)
$$

## Solving sine equations

### Solve $sin\theta=0.5$ for values of $\theta$ between $0\degree$ and $360\degree$.

- $\sin^{-1}(0.5)=30\degree$
- $180\degree-30\degree=150\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=30\degree,150\degree$

### Solve $sin\theta=0.5$ for values of $\theta$ between $0\degree$ and $720\degree$.

- $\sin^{-1}(0.5)=30\degree$
- $180\degree-30\degree=150\degree$
- $30\degree+360\degree=390\degree$
- $150\degree+360\degree=510\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=30\degree,150\degree,390\degree,510\degree$

### Solve $sin\theta=-0.5$ for values of $\theta$ between $0\degree$ and $720\degree$.

- $\sin^{-1}(-0.5)=-30\degree$
- $180\degree-(-30\degree)=210\degree$
- $-30\degree+360\degree=330\degree$
- $210\degree+360\degree=570\degree$
- $330\degree+360\degree=690\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=210\degree,330\degree,570\degree,690\degree$

### Solve $sin\theta=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for values of $\theta$ between $-360\degree$ and $360\degree$.

- $\sin^{-1}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})=60\degree$
- $180\degree-60\degree=120\degree$
- $60\degree-360\degree=-300\degree$
- $120\degree-360\degree=-240\degree$
- **Answer**: $\theta=-300\degree,-240\degree,60\degree,120\degree$
