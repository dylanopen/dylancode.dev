title: Minimum spanning tree
---

A *minimum spanning tree* (MST) is a special type of [subgraph](/subgraph) on
a [network](/network) that connects all the [nodes](/network-node) together
with the minimum possible total [weight](/network-arc) for the connections.

A minimum spanning tree is a type of [tree](/graph-tree). It does **not*
contain any [cycles](/graph-cycle), and there is exactly one path between any
two nodes in the tree.

Finding the minimum spanning tree is also known as the *minimum connector
problem*.

## Properties of a minimum spanning tree

Some important properties of a minimum spanning tree are:
- It includes all the nodes in the original network.
- It has exactly `N-1` edges, where `N` is the number of
  [nodes](/network-node) in the network.
- The total weight of the edges in the MST is the lowest possible.
- There are no cycles in the MST.
