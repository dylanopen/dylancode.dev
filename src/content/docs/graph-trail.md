title: Graph trail
---

A **trail** is just like a [walk](/graph-walk) in a [graph](/graph), except that
you are not allowed to traverse the same [edge](/graph-edge) more than once.

## Visiting vertices and edges

- You can visit the same [vertex](/graph-vertex) multiple times in a trail.
- However, you cannot traverse the same [edge](/graph-edge) more than once.
