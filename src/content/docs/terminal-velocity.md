title: Terminal velocity
---

When an object is falling through a fluid (or, less commonly, accelerating
across a solid surface with friction), it will eventually reach a point where
the resistive forces (drag or friction) are equal in magnitude to the driving
force (usually gravity), and the object will stop accelerating and continue to
move at a constant velocity.

This velocity is called the *terminal velocity* of the object.

> we'll focus on terminal velocity in the context of an object falling through a
  fluid under the force of gravity. The same principles apply to an object
  accelerating across a solid surface with friction.

## What happens when an object is falling?

When any object falls through any fluid, it *speeds up* because of the force
of gravity causing it to **accelerate** downwards. The velocity increases.

However, as velocity increases, the drag force (or frictional force) also
increases. It increases at a faster rate than the velocity, so the drag force
will eventually increase so much to the point where it becomes equal in
magnitude to the gravity.

Basically, when an object gets fast enough, the air resistance becomes equal
to the weight of the object.

## What happens at terminal velocity?

When the drag force becomes equal in magnitude to the weight of the object, the
object will stop accelerating and will continue to fall at a constant velocity -
the terminal velocity.

So it stops *accelerating* but it doesn't stop *moving* - it continues to fall,
but at a constant velocity (doesn't speed up anymore).

## What affects terminal velocity?

- The object's mass:
  - A heavier object has a greater weight force
  - It needs a greater drag force to balance the weight
  - So it needs to fall faster to generate that drag force
  - So it has a higher terminal velocity
- The surface area of the object (and how streamlined it is):
  - A larger surface area increases the drag force for a given velocity
  - So it can balance the weight at a lower velocity
  - So it has a lower terminal velocity
- The density of the fluid:
  - A denser fluid increases the drag force for a given velocity
  - So it can balance the weight at a lower velocity
  - So it has a lower terminal velocity
