title: Graph edge
---

An **edge** of a graph connects two [nodes](/graph-node) together.

Edges can have a *direction* if they are on a [directed graph](/directed-graph),
as directed edges can only be traversed in one direction.

If they're on a [network](/network), edges can also have a *weight*. Edges on a
network are known as [arcs](/network-arc).
