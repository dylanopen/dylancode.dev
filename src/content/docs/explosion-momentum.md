title: Explosion momentum
---

Just like in any other collision, the total momentum and kinetic energy of a
closed system is conserved in an explosion.

**However**: the *type* of energy may change in an explosion. For example:
- The chemical energy stored in the explosive material may be converted into
  kinetic energy of the fragments of the explosion.
- The kinetic energy of the fragments may be converted into heat and sound
  energy as they collide with each other and with the surroundings.

> In short, it may seem like some kinetic energy is 'lost' or 'gained', because
> it's converted from one type of energy to another.  
> In reality, the total energy of the system stays the same.
