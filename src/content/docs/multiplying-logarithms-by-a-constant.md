title: Multiplying logarithms by a constant
---

When raising a logarithm to a power, you can bring the power out in front as a
multiplier:

$$
\log_b(x^k) = k \times \log_b(x)
$$

### Example: Evaluate $\log_2(32^3)$

- Bring the power of 3 to the front: $3 \times \log_2(32)$.
- $\log_2(32)=5$ because $2^5=32$.
- So, $3 \times \log_2(32) = 3 \times 5 = 15$.
- **Answer:** $15$.

### Example: Evaluate $\log_{10}(1000^4)$

- Bring the power of 4 to the front: $4 \times \log_{10}(1000)$.
- $\log_{10}(1000)=3$ because $10^3=1000$.
- So, $4 \times \log_{10}(1000) = 4 \times 3 = 12$.
- **Answer:** $12$.

## Splitting up a logarithm with a multiplier

You can also split up a logarithm with a multiplier into a logarithm with an
exponent:

$$
k \times \log_b(x) = \log_b(x^k)
$$

### Example: Write $4 \times \log_3(9)$ as a single logarithm

- The power will become 4: $\log_3(9^4)$.
- $9^4 = 6561$.
- So, $4 \times \log_3(9) = \log_3(6561)$.
- **Answer:** $\log_3(6561)$.
