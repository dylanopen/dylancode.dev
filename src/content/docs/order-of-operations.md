title: Order of operations
---

The *order of operations* tells us which operations (e.g. addition,
multiplication, powers) to do first when finding the value of an expression.

## Abbreviations

There are lots of abbreviations to remember the order of operations. The most common ones are:
- **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and
  Subtraction)
- **BODMAS** (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and
  Subtraction)
- **PEMDAS** (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition) -
  this is more commonly used in the USA.

In this page, we'll use **BIDMAS**.

## The order

Whenever we evaluate an expression, we should do it in this order:

1. **Brackets**: Anything inside brackets (parentheses) should be done first.
2. **Indices**: We then do any powers or roots (e.g. squares, square roots).
3. **Division and multiplication**:
4. **Addition and subtraction**

> Note: When we have multiple operations of the same rank (e.g. both division
> and multiplication), we do them from left to right.

## Examples

### Example: Evaluate $3 + 4 \times 2$

- First, we do the multiplication: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
- Then, we do the addition: $3 + 8 = 11$.
- **Answer**: $11$.

### Example: Evaluate $(2 + 3)^2$

- First, we do the brackets: $2 + 3 = 5$.
- Then, we do the indices: $5^2 = 25$.
- **Answer**: $25$.

### Example: Evaluate $10 - 4 \div 2 + 3 \times 2$

- First, we do the division: $4 \div 2 = 2$.
- Then, we do the multiplication: $3 \times 2 = 6$.
- Next, we do the subtraction: $10 - 2 = 8$.
- Finally, we do the addition: $8 + 6 = 14$.
- **Answer**: $14$.

### Example: Evaluate $5 + (6 - 2)^2 \div 2$

- First, we do the brackets: $6 - 2 = 4$.
- Then, we do the indices: $4^2 = 16$.
- Next, we do the division: $16 \div 2 = 8$.
- Finally, we do the addition: $5 + 8 = 13$.
- **Answer**: $13$.

### Example: Evaluate $8 \div 2(2 + 2)$

- First, we do the brackets: $2 + 2 = 4$.
- Then, we do the division: $8 \div 2 = 4$.
- Next, we do the multiplication: $4 \times 4 = 16$.
- **Answer**: $16$.
