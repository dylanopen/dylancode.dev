title: Arc length from radians
---

To find the length of an arc (of a sector), we can just calculate:

$$
r\theta
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the sector('s circle)
- $\theta$ is the angle of the sector

## Equation

The full equation would be:

$$
l=r\theta
$$

where:
- $l$ is the length of the arc
- $r$ is the radius of the circle
- $\theta$ is the angle of the sector
