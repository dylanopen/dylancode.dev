title: Exponential graph gradient
---

An important property of an exponential graph is that the *gradient8 of it
is **directly proportional** to the value of $y$ at that point.

That means that, for a function in the form $f(x)=a^x$, we can write the 
gradient as $f'(x)=ka^x$ (where $k$ is a constant of proportionality).

In other words, the gradient of the graph is the $y$ coordinate multiplied
by something.

## Gradient of $e^x$

There's a special case of this when the base is $e$. The gradient at any
point is *exactly the same* as the $y$ value at that point.

We'll learn more about that in the [base e exponentials](/base-e-exponentials)
topic, but for now, just remember that the gradient of $e^x$ is $e^x$ itself.
