title: Real numbers
---

*Real numbers* are all the numbers that can be found on a number line. This
includes both *rational* and *irrational* numbers.

The opposite of a *real number* is a *complex number* (which includes the
imaginary unit $i$).

> More simply, a real number is any number with only a real part (no imaginary
> part, so no coefficient of $i$).

## Notation

The set of real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol $\mathbb{R}$:

$$
\mathbb{R} = \{ x \mid x \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ or } x \in \mathbb{I} \}
$$

## Contained values

$$
\mathbb{R} = -\infty, \ldots, +\infty
$$

## Examples of real numbers

- $-10$
- $0$
- $3.14$
- $\frac{1}{2}$
- $\sqrt{2}$
- $\pi$
- $i^2$ (simplifies to $-1$, which is real)

## Non-examples of real numbers

- $i$ (imaginary constant)
- $3 + 4i$ (complex number with real and imaginary parts)
- $-2i$ (pure imaginary number)
- $5 - i$ (complex number with real and imaginary parts)
