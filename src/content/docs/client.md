title: Client
---

A *client* is a computer that makes requests to a [server](/server) in order to
get a response.

We can use that response to do things like:
- display a website in a web browser
- download a file from the internet
- send an email
- stream a video
- (really anything else that uses *networking*, e.g. the internet)

The key thing is that:
- the **client** *sends* the request and *receives* the response
- the **server** *receives* the request and *sends* the response
- (usually)
