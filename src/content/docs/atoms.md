title: Atoms
---

- Everything is made of atoms.
- They are the 'building blocks of matter'.
- Atoms are *very* small - they have a radius of about 0.1 nanometers.

> The definition of an atom is "the smallest part of an element that can exist".

## Subatomic particles

Atoms are made up of 3 types of *subatomic* particles (the things inside the
atom itself):
- [protons](/protons) - positively charged particles found in the nucleus
- [neutrons](/neutrons) - neutral particles found in the nucleus
- [electrons](/electrons) - negatively charged particles which orbit the
  nucleus

## Models of the atom

There are lots of different ways we can model the atom.

The one that is most commonly used today is the *Bohr model*, which shows a
small nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around it
in their own *energy levels* (called *shells*).
