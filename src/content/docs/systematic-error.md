A systematic error is an *error with the system* - where the system is our
method for doing the experiment! It can also be an error with the measuring
instrument itself - e.g. an uncalibrated scale that always reads 0.5kg too
heavy.

It's basically when our **method is wrong**, or will lead to misleading results
because of faulty equipment.

## Causes of systematic errors

- Measuring the wrong thing (e.g. measuring temperature in Celsius when you
  should be measuring in Kelvin)
- Using faulty or uncalibrated equipment (e.g. a scale that is not zeroed
  properly)
- Consistently misreading the instrument

## How do systematic errors affect measurements?

A lot. The issue is that, while random errors can be reduced by taking
multiple measurements and averaging them, systematic errors will always
skew the results in the same direction. For example, if you're using a scale
that is not zeroed properly and always reads 0.5kg too heavy, every measurement
you take will be off by 0.5kg, no matter how many times you measure it. It's not
0.5kg in *either way* - it's always too heavy.

## Reducing systematic errors

To reduce systematic errors, you can:
- Calibrate your measuring instruments regularly
- Use more accurate measuring instruments
- Double-check your measurement methods to make sure you're measuring the
  correct quantity
- Cross-check measurements with different instruments or methods
- Train the person doing the measurements to do the method properly
