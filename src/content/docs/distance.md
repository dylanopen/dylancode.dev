title: Distance
---

*Distance* measures how long the path that we travelled was.

It's not in any specific direction, so it's a [scalar quantity](/scalar-quantity).

## Example

- Let's suppose we walk 1km north, then 2km back.
- THe total *distance* we travelled is 3km, because that's the length of the
  path of the journey that we walked.

## $\text{distance}=\text{speed}\times\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the distance, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the speed, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$
