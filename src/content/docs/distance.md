title: Distance
---

*Distance* measures how long the path that we travelled was.

It's not in any specific direction, so it's a [scalar quantity](/scalar-quantity).

## Example

- Let's suppose we walk 1km north, then 2km back.
- THe total *distance* we travelled is 3km, because that's the length of the
  path of the journey that we walked.

## $\text{distance}=\text{speed}\times\text{time}$

$$
s=vt
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the distance, measured in metres, $m$
- $v$ is the speed, measured in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$ ($m/s$)
- $t$ is the time, measured in seconds, $s$

### A van drives at a speed of $20ms^{-1}$ for 10s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=20\times10=200$
- Answer: $200m$

### A car drives at a speed of $15ms^{-1}$ for 5s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=15\times5=75$
- Answer: $75m$

### A bike drives at a speed of $0.5ms^{-1}$ for 20s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=0.5\times20=10$
- Answer: $10m$

### A truck drives at a speed of $30ms^{-1}$ for 8s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=30\times8=240$- Answer: $240m$

### A car drives at a speed of $25ms^{-1}$ for 12s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=25\times12=300$
- Answer: $300m$

### A van drives at a speed of $40ms^{-1}$ for 15s. Calculate the distance.

- $s=vt$
- $s=40\times15=600$
- Answer: $600m$

### A person cycles for 4h until reaching a destination 100km away. Calculate their average speed.

- $s=vt$
- $v=\frac st$
- $v=\frac{100}{4}=25$
- Answer: $25kmh^{-1}$
