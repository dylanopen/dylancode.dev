title: Snell's law
---

If we have two objects with 'absolute' refractive indexes of $n_1$ and $n_2$,
we can say that:

$$
n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_1
$$

Where:
- $n_1$ is the refractive index of the first material.
- $n_2$ is the refractive index of the second material.
- $\theta_1$ is the angle at which light *enters* the boundary
- $\theta_2$ is the angle at which light *leaves* the boundary

Assuming we know 3 out of the 4 unknowns, we can find any of them. We can 
re-arrange the formula above into any of:
- $n_1=\frac{n_2\sin\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1}$
- $n_2=\frac{n_1\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}$
- $\theta_1=\sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2\sin\theta_2}{n_1})$
- $\theta_2=\sin^{-1}(\frac{n_1\sin\theta_1}{n_2})$

This is Snell's law!
