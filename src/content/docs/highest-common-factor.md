title: Highest common factor

## What is the highest common factor?

The HCF (highest common factor) of numbers is the *largest factor that goes into
both/all numbers*.

For example, the HCF of $12$ and $15$ is $3$, because $3$ is the largest number
that goes into both $12$ and $15$.

## Finding the highest common factor

To find the highest common factor, you need to be familiar with [prime factor decomposition](prime-factor-decomposition).

Here are the steps:
1. Find the prime factor decomposition of each number.
2. Find the common prime factors (and *how many* of each there are)
3. Multiply the common prime factors together to get the HCF

### Example: Find the HCF of $18$ and $24$.

1. Find the prime factor decomposition of each number:
   - $18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2 \times 3^2$
   - $24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^3 \times 3$
2. Find the common prime factors:
   - Both have at least $2^1$ as a factor
   - Both have at least $3^1$ as a factor
3. Multiply the common prime factors together:
   - $HCF(18, 24) = 2^1 \times 3^1 = 2 \times 3 = 6$

**Answer**: $6$

### Example: Find the HCF of $36$, $60$ and $84$.

1. Find the prime factor decomposition of each number:
   - $36 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2^2 \times 3^2$
   - $60 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$
   - $84 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 7^1$
2. Find the common prime factors:
   - All have at least $2^2$ as a factor
   - All have at least $3^1$ as a factor
3. Multiply the common prime factors together:
    - $HCF(36, 60, 84) = 2^2 \times 3^1 = 4 \times 3 = 12$

**Answer**: $12$

## Uses of the highest common factor

We can use the HCF to:
- simplify fractions
- divide things up more easily
- simplify ratios
- (and more)
