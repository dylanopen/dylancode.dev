title: Small angle approximation
---

## The approximations

As $\theta$ becomes small:
- $\sin\theta\approx\theta$
- $\cos\theta\approx1-\frac12\theta^2$
- $\tan\theta\approx\theta$

> These **only** work when working with [radians](/radian) - not degrees.

## What is a small angle?

A 'small' angle is considered anything under **half a radian**.

## Sine approximation

For a small angle $\theta$, when working with **radians**:

$$
\sin\theta\approx\theta
$$

## Tangent approximation

For a small angle $\theta$, when working with **radians**:

$$
\tan\theta\approx\theta
$$

## Cosine approximation

For a small angle $\theta$, when working with **radians**:

$$
\cos\theta\approx1-\frac12\theta^2
$$

### Approximate the value of $\cos0.4$, then find the percentage error

- $\cos(0.4)$
- $\approx1-\frac12(0.4)^2$
- $=1-\frac{0.16}2$
- $=1-0.08$
- $=0.92$

The *actual value* is around $0.92106$, so:
- Difference: $0.92106-0.92=0.00106$
- $\frac{0.00106}{0.92106}$
- $=0.00115$
- $=0.115\%$
