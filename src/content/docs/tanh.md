$\tanh$ is the **hyperbolic tangent**. It doesn't have a definition directly in
terms of $e$, but just like regular $\tan$, we know we can find $\tanh$ with the
formula:

$$
\tanh=\frac{\sinh}{\cosh}
$$

## Finding a formula

Because $\tanh=\frac{\sinh}{\cosh}$, we know that:

$$
\tanh\equiv\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}2\div\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}2
$$

We can simplify that to

$$
\tanh\equiv\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}
$$
