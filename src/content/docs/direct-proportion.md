title: Direct proportion
---

If two variables are directly proportional to each other, it means that if one
of the variables *doubles*, for example, the other variable will also
*double*.

In other words, the ***ratio*** between the two variables remains
**constant**.

Importantly, if $x$ is directly proportional to $y$, then $y$ is also directly
proportional to $x$. $y$ is equal to a constant multiplied by $x$, and $x$ is
equal to a constant multiplied by $y$.

## Expressing direct proportion

- If $y$ is directly proportional to $x$, we can write this as:
  - $x \propto y$
- Because $y$ is directly proportional to $x$, it must be equal to a constant
  multiplied by $x$:
  - $y = kx$
  - where $k$ is the *constant of proportionality*.
- Similarly, because $x$ is directly proportional to $y$, it must be equal to a
  constant multiplied by $y$:
  - $x = \frac{1}{k}y$
  - where $\frac{1}{k}$ is the constant of proportionality in this case.

### $a$ is directly proportional to $b$. Write $b$ as an equation in terms of $a$ and the constant of proportionality $k$.

- $a\propto b$
- $b = ka$
- **Answer:** $b = ka$

### $y$ is directly proportional to $x^2$. Write $y$ as an equation in terms of $x$ and the constant of proportionality $k$.

- $y \propto x^2$
- $y = kx^2$
- **Answer:** $y = kx^2$

## Finding the constant of proportionality

In any question, you will be given a pair of values for the two variables
that are directly proportional to each other. You can use these values to find
the constant of proportionality - just by substituting them into the equation
$y = kx$, if $y$ is directly proportional to $x$.

### $y\propto x$. When $x = 4$, $y = 10$. Find the constant of proportionality.

- $y = kx$
- Substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 10$:
  - $10 = k \times 4$
- Rearranging to find $k$:
  - $k = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5$
- **Answer:** $k = 2.5$

### $a\propto b$. When $b = 12$, $a = 3$. Find the constant of proportionality.

- $a = kb$
- Substitute $b = 12$ and $a = 3$:
  - $3 = k \times 12$
- Rearranging to find $k$:
  - $k = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25$
- **Answer:** $k = 0.25$

## Using direct proportion to find unknown values

Once you have found the constant of proportionality, you can use it to find
unknown values of either variable.

You will probably have a question that tells you:
- that two variables are directly proportional to each other
- gives you a pair of values for the two variables
- asks you to find an unknown value of one of the variables, given a value of
  the other variable

### $y\propto x$. When $x = 2$, $y = 8$. Find $y$ when $x = 5$.

- First, find the constant of proportionality:
  - $y = kx$
  - Substitute $x = 2$ and $y = 8$:
    - $8 = k \times 2$
  - Rearranging to find $k$:
    - $k = \frac{8}{2} = 4$
- Now, use $k$ to find $y$ when $x = 5$:
  - $y = kx$
  - Substitute $k = 4$ and $x = 5$:
    - $y = 4 \times 5 = 20$
- **Answer:** $y = 20$

### $a\propto \sqrt b$. When $b = 9$, $a = 6$. Find $a$ when $b = 16$.

- First, find the constant of proportionality:
  - $a = k\sqrt{b}$
  - Substitute $b = 9$ and $a = 6$:
    - $6 = k \times \sqrt{9}$
    - $6 = k \times 3$
  - Rearranging to find $k$:
    - $k = \frac{6}{3} = 2$
- Now, use $k$ to find $a$ when $b = 16$:
  - $a = k\sqrt{b}$
  - Substitute $k = 2$ and $b = 16$:
    - $a = 2 \times \sqrt{16}$
    - $a = 2 \times 4 = 8$
- **Answer:** $a = 8$
