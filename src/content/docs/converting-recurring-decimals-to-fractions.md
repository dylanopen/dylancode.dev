title: Converting recurring decimals to fractions
---

Converting recurring decimals into fractions is more difficult than converting
*terminating* decimals, but there's an ordered process that makes more sense
with an example.

## Examples

### Example: Convert $0.\overline6$ to a fraction

- let $x = 0.\overline6$ (the recurring decimal we want to convert)
- multiply both sides by 10 (since there's 1 digit in the repeating part, so
  we use $10^1$):
  - $10x = 6.\overline6$
- subtract the original equation from this new equation:
  - $10x - x = 6.\overline6 - 0.\overline6$
  - $9x = 6$
- solve for $x$:
  - $x = \frac{6}{9}$
  - $x = \frac{2}{3}$ (simplified)
- **Answer**: $0.\overline6 = \frac{2}{3}$

### Example: Convert $0.\overline{27}$ to a fraction

- let $x = 0.\overline{27}$
- multiply both sides by 100 (since there are 2 digits in the repeating part, so we
  use $10^2$):
  - $100x = 27.\overline{27}$
- subtract the original equation from this new equation:
  - $100x - x = 27.\overline{27} - 0.\overline{27}$
  - $99x = 27$
- solve for $x$:
  - $x = \frac{27}{99}$
  - $x = \frac{3}{11}$ (simplified)
- **Answer**: $0.\overline{27} = \frac{3}{11}$

### Example: Convert $0.1\overline{3}$ to a fraction

- let $x = 0.1\overline{3}$
- multiply both sides by 10 (to move past the non-repeating part):
  - $10x = 1.\overline{3}$
- multiply both sides by 10 again (to move past the repeating part):
  - $100x = 13.\overline{3}$
- subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:
  - $100x - 10x = 13.\overline{3} - 1.\overline{3}$
  - $90x = 12$
- solve for $x$:
  - $x = \frac{12}{90}$
  - $x = \frac{2}{15}$ (simplified)
- **Answer**: $0.1\overline{3} = \frac{2}{15}$

### Example: Convert $2.4\overline{56}$ to a fraction

- let $x = 2.4\overline{56}$
- multiply both sides by 10 (to move past the non-repeating part):
  - $10x = 24.\overline{56}$
- multiply both sides by 100 (to move past the repeating part):
  - $1000x = 2456.\overline{56}$
- subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:
  - $1000x - 10x = 2456.\overline{56} - 24.\overline{56}$
  - $990x = 2432$
- solve for $x$:
  - $x = \frac{2432}{990}$
  - $x = \frac{1216}{495}$ (simplified)
- **Answer**: $2.4\overline{56} = \frac{1216}{495}$

### Example: Convert $7.1\overline{857}$ to a fraction

- let $x = 7.1\overline{857}$
- multiply both sides by 10 (to move past the non-repeating part):
  - $10x = 71.\overline{857}$
- multiply both sides by 1000 (to move past the repeating part):
  - $10000x = 71857.\overline{857}$
- subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:
  - $10000x - 10x = 71857.\overline{857} - 71.\overline{857}$
  - $9990x = 71786$
- solve for $x$:
  - $x = \frac{71786}{9990}$
  - $x = \frac{35893}{4995}$ (simplified)
- **Answer**: $7.1\overline{857} = \frac{35893}{4995}$
