title: Graph cycle
---

A *cycle* on a [graph](/graph) is a [path](/graph-path) that starts and ends at
the same vertex, with at least one [edge](/graph-edge) and no other repeated
vertices. In other words, a cycle is a closed loop in the graph.

- The length of a cycle is the number of edges it contains.

> In short, a cycle is a closed loop that doesn't visit any vertex twice
  (except the one it starts/ends at).

## Visiting vertices and edges

- Only the starting vertex is visited twice.
- All other vertices and edges are visited exactly once.
