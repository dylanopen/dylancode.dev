title: Graph vertex
---

A **vertex** (or **node**) in graph theory is a part of a graph that **edges**
connect to.

They can represent various different things depending on what the graph is used
to represent.

## Degree of a vertex

The *degree* of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

For example, if a vertex has 3 edges connected to it, its degree is 3.

### Degree in directed graphs

In a **directed graph**, we distinguish between:
- **In-degree**: The number of edges coming *into* the vertex.
- **Out-degree**: The number of edges going *out* from the vertex.
