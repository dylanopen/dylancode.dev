title: Accuracy
---

Accuracy is simply how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value.

For example, if we design an experiment to measure the boiling point of water,
and we get a result of 100.5°C, that measurement is quite accurate because it's
very close to the true value of 100°C. But if we get a result of 90°C, that
measurement is not very accurate because it's very far from the true value.
