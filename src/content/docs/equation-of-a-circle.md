title: Equation of a circle
---

There is a general equation which defines the shape of a *circle* on a graph.

For any point that lies on the circle, the equation will be true and this
creates a circle if we would plot it using a graphing calculator, for example.

## General equation of a circle

$$
(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2
$$$

Where:
- $(a, b)$ is the coordinate of the **centre** of the circle:
  - $a$ is the x-coordinate of the centre
  - $b$ is the y-coordinate of the centre
- $r$ is the **radius** of the circle.

## Equation of a circle at the origin

If we have a circle with a centre at the origin (0,0), then the equation would
be $(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2=r^2$, which simplifies to:

$$
x^2+y^2=r^2
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius

## Finding the radius and centre of a circle from its equation

Knowing the equation above, we can use that to find the radius and/or the centre
coordinates of a circle, given just its equation.

### Example: find the radius of the circle with equation $(x-4)^2+(x+2)^2=36$

- Given the equation above, we know that $36$ must be the radius *squared*:
- $r^2=36$
- $r=\sqrt{36}=6$
- **Answer**: the radius is $6$

### Example: find the centre of the circle with equation $(x-3)^2+(x-2)^2=16$

- For the general form $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$:
  - $a$ is $3$
  - $b$ is $2$
  - $r^2$ is $4$ (so $r$ is $4$)
- The coordinates of the centre are $(a,b)$.
- $a=3$ and $b=2$, so $(a,b)=(3,2)$
- **Answer**: the centre is $(3,2)$

### Example: find the centre of the circle with equation $(x+3)^2+(x-2)^2=16$

- For the general form $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$:
  - $a$ is $-3$: negative, because $x+3$ is equivalent to $x-(-3)$
  - $b$ is $2$
  - $r^2$ is $4$ (so $r$ is $4$)
- The coordinates of the centre are $(a,b)$.
- $a=-3$ and $b=2$, so $(a,b)=(-3,2)$
- **Answer**: the centre is $(-3,2)$

### Example: find the centre and radius of the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=25$

- Circle is at the origin, so:
  - $a=0$
  - $b=0$
- Centre at $(a,b)=(0,0)$
- $r^2=25$
- $r=\sqrt{25}=5$
- **Answer**: the centre is $(0,0)$ and the radius is $5$

## Finding the equation of a circle from its centre and radius

We can also go the other way round - finding the equation of a circle if we know
its centre **and** its radius.

### Example: find the equation of the circle with centre $(4,5)$ and radius $7$

- $(a,b)=(4,5)$
- $a=4$
- $b=5$
- $r=7$
- $(x-a)^2+(x-b)^2=r^2$
- Substitute for $a$, $b$ and $r$:
  - $(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2=7^2$
  - $(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2=49$
- **Answer**: the equation is $(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2=49$

### Example: find the equation of the circle with centre $(-3,2)$ and radius $5$

- $(a,b)=(-3,2)$
- $a=-3$
- $b=2$
- $r=5$
- $(x-a)^2+(x-b)^2=r^2$
- Substitute for $a$, $b$ and $r$:
  - $(x-(-3))^2+(y-2)^2=5^2$
  - $(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2=25$
- **Answer**: the equation is $(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2=25$

### Example: find the equation of the circle with centre $(0,0)$ and radius $4$

- $(a,b)=(0,0)$
- $a=0$
- $b=0$
- $r=4$
- $(x-a)^2+(x-b)^2=r^2$
- Substitute for $a$, $b$ and $r$:
  - $(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2=4^2$
  - $x^2+y^2=16$
- **Answer**: the equation is $x^2+y^2=16$
