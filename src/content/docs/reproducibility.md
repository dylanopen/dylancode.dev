title: Reproducibility
---

Reproducibility measures how well an experiment can be repeated by *a different
person* in *different conditions* (e.g. a different lab).

## Example of repeatability

For example, let’s say we want to measure the boiling point of a substance. We
set up our apparatus and measure the temperature at which the water boils. Two
different people do the experiment in two different environments. The results
were:
- Experiment 1: 109.2°C
- Experiment 2: 102.4°C (done by a different person)

These results are *not* reproducible, because they vary a lot depending on which
conditions the experiment was done under.

## Repeatability vs reproducibility

- Reproducibility measures: if someone else does the same experiment under
  different conditions (e.g. different lab, different equipment), do they get
  similar results? (**different conditions**)
- Repeatability measures: if we do the same experiment multiple times under the
  same conditions, do we get similar results **doing it ourselves**?
