title: Work done
---

*Work* is *done* when a force is applied to an object to make it move.

Work done is the same as the *energy transferred* to the object.

## Units

Because work done is just another way of saying energy transferred, it has the
same units: joules (J).

## Energy transfer

Importantly, the *type* of energy often changes. For example, the energy may be
transferred from chemical energy in fuel to kinetic energy of a moving car.
