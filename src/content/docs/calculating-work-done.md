title: Calculating work done
---

We can calculate the work done by a force using the formula:

$$
\text{Work done} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$

Or, in symbols:

> $$
> W = Fd
> $$

Where:
- $W$ is the work done, in joules, $J$
- $F$ is the force applied, in newtons, $N$
- $d$ is the distance moved **in the direction of the force**, in metres, $m$

## Examples

### A force of 10 N moves an object 5 m in the direction of the force. How much work is done?

- $W=Fd$
- $F=10\,N$
- $d=5\,m$
- $W=10\,N \times 5\,m$
- $W = 50\,J$

### A force of 20 N moves an object 3 m in the direction of the force. How much work is done?

- $W=Fd$
- $F=20\,N$
- $d=3\,m$
- $W=20\,N \times 3\,m$
- $W = 60\,J$

### 200 J of work is done to move an object 4 m in the direction of the force. What is the force applied?

- $W=Fd$
- $W=200\,J$
- $d=4\,m$
- $F=\frac{W}{d}$
- $F=\frac{200\,J}{4\,m}$
- $F = 50\,N$

### 150 J of work is done to move an object 5 m in the direction of the force. What is the force applied?

- $W=Fd$
- $W=150\,J$
- $d=5\,m$
- $F=\frac{W}{d}$
- $F=\frac{150\,J}{5\,m}$
- $F = 30\,N$

### 250 J of work is done using a force of 25 N. How far does the object move in the direction of the force?

- $W=Fd$
- $W=250\,J$
- $F=25\,N$
- $d=\frac{W}{F}$
- $d=\frac{250\,J}{25\,N}$
- $d = 10\,m$

### 300 J of work is done using a force of 30 N. How far does the object move in the direction of the force?

- $W=Fd$
- $W=300\,J$
- $F=30\,N$
- $d=\frac{W}{F}$
- $d=\frac{300\,J}{30\,N}$
- $d = 10\,m$
