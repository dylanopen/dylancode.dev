title: Simplifying fractions
---

When we have a fraction, such as $\frac{15}{30}$, we often want to write it as
simply as we can.

## Fraction equivalence

To simplify fractions, we need to understand one simple rule: if we multiply or
divide both the top and bottom of a fraction by the same number, we get an
equivalent fraction. In other words, the value of the fraction does not change.

For example, if we have the fraction $\frac{4}{6}$, we can divide both the top
and bottom by 2 to get:

- $\frac{4\div2}{6\div2}=\frac{2}{3}$

This fraction is equivalent to $\frac{4}{6}$, but it is in a simpler form.

## Simplifying fractions

To simplify a fraction, we need to find the highest number that goes into both
the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) of the fraction.

This is called the [highest common factor (HCF)](/highest-common-factor) - see
[here](/highest-common-factor) for more details on how to find it.

### Example: Simplify $\frac{18}{24}$

- The HCF of 18 and 24 is 6.
- We can divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 6:
  - $\frac{18\div6}{24\div6}=\frac{3}{4}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{3}{4}$

### Example: Simplify $\frac{45}{60}$

- The HCF of 45 and 60 is 15.
- We can divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 15:
  - $\frac{45\div15}{60\div15}=\frac{3}{4}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{3}{4}$

### Example: Simplify $\frac{56}{98}$

- The HCF of 56 and 98 is 14.
- We can divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 14:
  - $\frac{56\div14}{98\div14}=\frac{4}{7}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{4}{7}$

### Example: Simplify $\frac{81x}{108x}$

- The HCF of 81x and 108x is 27x.
- We can divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by 27x:
  - $\frac{81x\div27x}{108x\div27x}=\frac{3}{4}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{3}{4}$

### Example: Simplify $\frac{50y^2}{75y}$

- The HCF of $50y^2$ and $75y$ is $25y$.
- We can divide both the top and bottom of the fraction by $25y$:
  - $\frac{50y^2\div25y}{75y\div25y}=\frac{2y}{3}$
- **Answer**: $\frac{2y}{3}$
