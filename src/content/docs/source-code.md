title: Source code
---

Source code is the human-readable code that we write.

For example, a C source file may look something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("I'm a source file!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

If we save this code in a file called `example.c`, then `example.c` is the
source code for our program.

But if we compile the program into a binary called `example`, then `example` is
*not* the source code - it's the compiled binary version of the source code,
which is **not** human-readable.

> In short, source code is the code we write, before it's compiled or
> interpreted into a form that the computer can execute.
