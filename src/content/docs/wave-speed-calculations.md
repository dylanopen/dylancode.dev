title: Wave speed calculations
---

Using the formulae covered in these chapters:
- [wave speed](/wave-speed)
- [wave frequency](/wave-frequency)
- [wavelength](/wavelength)

...we can do some example calculations!

## A reminder of the equation

$$
\text{Wave speed} = \text{Frequency} \times \text{Wavelength}
$$

With symbols:

$$
v = f\lambda
$$

## Examples

### Calculate the wave speed of a wave with a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 2 m.

- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $v=500\times2$ (substitute in the values)
- $v=1000 m/s$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 1000 m/s.

### Calculate the frequency of a wave with a speed of 340 m/s and a wavelength of 0.5 m.

- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$ (rearrange it)
- $f=\frac{340}{0.5}$ (substitute in the values)
- $f=680 Hz$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 680 Hz.

### Calculate the wavelength of a wave with a speed of 1500 m/s and a frequency of 3000 Hz.

- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $\lambda=\frac{v}{f}$ (rearrange it)
- $\lambda=\frac{1500}{3000}$ (substitute in the values)
- $\lambda=0.5 m$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 0.5 m.

### A wave has a frequency of 100 Hz and a wavelength of 3 m. What is its speed?

- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $v=100\times3$ (substitute in the values)
- $v=300 m/s$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 300 m/s.

### A wave travels at a speed of 600,000 mm/s and has a wavelength of 4 cm. What is its frequency?

- $600,000 mm/s = 600 m/s$ (convert speed to metres per second)
- $4 cm = 0.04 m$ (convert wavelength to metres)
- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$ (rearrange it)
- $f=\frac{600}{0.04}$ (substitute in the values)
- $f=15,000 Hz$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 15,000 Hz.

### A wave has a speed of 2 km/s and a frequency of 500 Hz. What is its wavelength?

- $2 km/s = 2000 m/s$ (convert speed to metres per second)
- $v=f\lambda$ (write our formula)
- $\lambda=\frac{v}{f}$ (rearrange it)
- $\lambda=\frac{2000}{500}$ (substitute in the values)
- $\lambda=4 m$ (calculate)
- **Answer**: 4 m.
