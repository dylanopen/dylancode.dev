title: Exponential function gradient
---

The *gradient* of an exponential graph at any point is directly proportional to
the value of the function at that point (or the $y$ coordinate of the graph).

This can be written as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = ky
$$

## Gradient of $e^x$

The graph of $y=e^x$ has an interesting property - its gradient at any point is
identical to the $y$ coordinate of that point.

For example, at $x=4$, the point on the graph is $(4, e^4)$. The gradient at
this point is also $e^4$.

This can be written as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} e^x = e^x
$$

> Reminder: this ONLY works for base $e$. Other bases will have different
> gradients to their $y$ values.

## Gradient of $e^{kx}$

When we have an exponential function with a coefficient in the exponent, i.e.
$y=e^{kx}$, the gradient is proportional to both the value of the function and
the coefficient $k$.

We can write this as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} e^{kx} = k e^{kx}
$$

For example, for the function $y=e^{3x}$, the gradient at any point is 3
times the $y$ value at that point.
