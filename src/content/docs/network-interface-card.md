title: Network interface card
---

A network interface card, or NIC, is essentially an *adapter* for the network.

Every device that connects to a network will have a NIC.

The type of NIC used determines the:
- speed of the network (which 'band' it can use).
- the transfer *medium* (i.e. through Ethernet, wired, or through Wi-Fi,
  wire**less**).
