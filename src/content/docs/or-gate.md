title: OR gate
---

An *OR gate* takes two input signals and produces an output signal that is `1`
if **at least one** of the input signals is `1`.

In other words, as long as they are *not* both `0`, the output will be `1`.

## Truth table

| Input A | Input B | Output (A OR B) |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
|    0    |    0    |      **0**      |
|    0    |    1    |      **1**      |
|    1    |    0    |      **1**      |
|    1    |    1    |      **1**      |
