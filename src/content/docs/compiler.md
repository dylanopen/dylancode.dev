title: Compiler
---

- Compilers work by reading the whole source code and translating it into
  machine code, **before** the program is run or distributed to users.
- The result is an *executable file* which can be run directly by the CPU.

#### Positives of compilers

- Runs faster
- Can be optimized for specific hardware
- Can be shared without source code (e.g. proprietary software)
- Catches most errors before running

#### Negatives of compilers

- Compiliation takes time
- Not as easy to use a debugger
