title: Number of intersections between graphs
---

Just like we can find the number of roots of an equation, we can also find the
number of intersections between two graphs.

## Steps

When we have two equations, we can find the number of intersections between
their graphs like this:

1. Write the equations in the form $y=...$ by moving all terms to one side
   except the $y$ term.
2. Set both equations equal to each other.
3. Write the resulting equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
4. Calculate the discriminant using $D = b^2 - 4ac$.

## A reminder of the meaning of the discriminant

- If $D > 0$, there are two intersections between the graphs.
- If $D = 0$, there is one intersection between the graphs (the graphs are
  tangent to each other).
- If $D < 0$, there are no intersections between the graphs.

## Examples

### Example: find the number of points where the graphs $y = x^2 + 2x + 3$ and $y = 3x - 1$ intersect

- No need to rearrange the equations, as they already have a $y$ on one side on
  its own.
- Set the equations equal to each other:
  - $$x^2 + 2x + 3 = 3x - 1$$
- Rearrange to the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:
  - $$x^2 + 2x + 3 - 3x + 1 = 0$$
  - $$x^2 - x + 4 = 0$$
- Calculate the discriminant:
  - $$D = (-1)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 4 = -15$$
- Since $D < 0$, there are no intersections between the graphs.
