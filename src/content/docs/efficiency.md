title: Efficiency
---

As mentioned in the article about [conservation of energy](/conservation-of-energy),
energy cannot be created or destroyed.

But it can be transferred from one form to another: and sometimes, we don't
*want* that energy form.

For example, in a computer CPU, we want the energy to be transferred as
efficiently as possible so that as little *heat* is produced as possible.

## Calculating efficiency as a decimal

The formula for calculating efficiency as a *decimal* is:

> $$
> \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}}
> $$

Or, if we're instead measuring the *power* used and produced, we can use:

> $$
> \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful power output}}{\text{Total power input}}
> $$

## Calculating efficiency as a percentage

The formula for calculating efficiency as a *percentage* is:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

If we're instead measuring the *power* used and produced, we can use:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful power output}}{\text{Total power input}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

## 100% efficiency

Almost nothing can be 100% efficient, because there are always some energy
losses in the system.

For example, in a car engine, some of the energy from the fuel is lost as heat and sound, so the efficience isn't anywhere close to 100%.

However: all energy transfers usually will end up as heat in the end. In a way,
heating machines (e.g. electric radiators) are 100% efficient, in that they 
transfer all the energy they use into heat energy - which is what we want them
to do!

## Examples

### A machine uses 1000 J of energy to produce 800 J of useful energy. What is the efficiency of the machine?

- $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}}$
- $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{800\,J}{1000\,J}$
- $\text{Efficiency} = 0.8$ (or 80%)

### A machine uses 2000 J of energy to produce 1500 J of useful energy. What is the efficiency of the machine?

- $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}}$
- $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{1500\,J}{2000\,J}$
- $\text{Efficiency} = 0.75$ (or 75%)

### A machine has an efficiency of 90% and produces 900 J of useful energy. How much energy does it use in total?

- $\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}} \right) \times 100\%$
- $0.9 = \frac{900\,J}{\text{Total energy input}}$
- $\text{Total energy input} = \frac{900\,J}{0.9}$
- $\text{Total energy input} = 1000\,J$

### A person charges a power bank. The total input energy was 800 kJ. The charging has an efficiency of 80%. They then charge their phone using the power bank, and the phone charging has an efficiency of 90%. How much energy is transferred to the phone in the end?

- $\text{Energy transferred to power bank} = \text{Total energy input} \times \text{Efficiency of charging power bank}$
- $\text{Energy transferred to power bank} = 800\,kJ \times 0.8$
- $\text{Energy transferred to power bank} = 640\,kJ$
- $\text{Energy transferred to phone} = \text{Energy transferred to power bank} \times \text{Efficiency of charging phone}$
- $\text{Energy transferred to phone} = 640\,kJ \times 0.9$
- $\text{Energy transferred to phone} = 576\,kJ$

### A machine has an efficiency of 70% and produces 700 J of useful energy. How much energy does it use in total?

- $\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}} \right) \times 100\%$
- $0.7 = \frac{700\,J}{\text{Total energy input}}$
- $\text{Total energy input} = \frac{700\,J}{0.7}$
- $\text{Total energy input} = 1000\,J$

### A machine with an efficiency of 0.8 uses 500 J of energy. How much useful energy does it produce?

- $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}}$
- $0.8 = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{500\,J}$
- $\text{Useful energy output} = 0.8 \times 500\,J$
- $\text{Useful energy output} = 400\,J$
