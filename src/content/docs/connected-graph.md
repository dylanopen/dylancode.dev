title: Connected graph
---

A *connected graph* is a type of [graph](/graph) where there is a path between
every pair of [vertices](/graph-vertex). In other words, you can get from any
vertex to any other vertex by following the [edges](/graph-edge) of the graph.

## Undirected vs. directed graphs

- In an *undirected graph*, the edges have no direction, so you can traverse
  them in both directions.
- A connected undirected graph means you can reach any vertex from any other
  vertex without considering edge directions.
- In a *directed graph* (or digraph), the edges have a specific direction, so we
  need to consider the direction of the edges to check if it is possible to get
  from any vertex to any other vertex.
