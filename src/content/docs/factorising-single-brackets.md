title: Factorising single brackets
---

When we have an expression such as $3(x+4)$, we can use the *distributive law*
to expand it:

- $3(x+4)=3x+12$

We know this from [expanding single brackets](/expanding-single-brackets).

We can also *go the other way* - take the expression $3x+12$ and put it *into*
a bracket, which would give us $3(x+4)$. This is called *factorising*.

## Steps

1. Find the [highest common factor (HCF)](/highest-common-factor) of the terms
   in the expression.
2. Write the HCF outside a set of brackets.
3. Divide each term in the expression by the HCF, and write the results inside
   the brackets.

## Examples

### Factorise $6x + 9$

- The HCF of $6x$ and $9$ is $3$.
- Write $3$ outside the brackets:
  - $3( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus or
    minus).
- Divide each term by $3$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{6x}{3} = 2x$
  - $\frac{9}{3} = 3$
- Write those results added together inside the brackets:
  - $3(2x + 3)$
- **Answer**: $3(2x + 3)$

### Factorise $12y - 8$

- The HCF of $12y$ and $8$ is $4$.
- Write $4$ outside the brackets:
  - $4( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus or
    minus).
- Divide each term by $4$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{12y}{4} = 3y$
  - $\frac{-8}{4} = -2$
- Write those results subtracted inside the brackets:
  - $4(3y - 2)$
- **Answer**: $4(3y - 2)$

### Factorise $15a + 25b$

- The HCF of $15a$ and $25b$ is $5$.
- Write $5$ outside the brackets:
  - $5( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus or
    minus).
- Divide each term by $5$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{15a}{5} = 3a$
  - $\frac{25b}{5} = 5b$
- Write those results added together inside the brackets:
  - $5(3a + 5b)$
- **Answer**: $5(3a + 5b)$

### Factorise $x^2 - 3x$

- The HCF of $x^2$ and $-3x$ is $x$.
- Write $x$ outside the brackets:
  - $x( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus or
    minus).
- Divide each term by $x$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{x^2}{x} = x$
  - $\frac{-3x}{x} = -3$
- Write those results subtracted inside the brackets:
  - $x(x - 3)$
- **Answer**: $x(x - 3)$

### Factorise $-8m^2n - 12mn^2$

- The HCF of $-8m^2n$ and $-12mn^2$ is $-4mn$.
- Write $-4mn$ outside the brackets:
  - $-4mn( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus
    or minus).
- Divide each term by $-4mn$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{-8m^2n}{-4mn} = 2m$
  - $\frac{-12mn^2}{-4mn} = 3n$
- Write those results added together inside the brackets:
  - $-4mn(2m + 3n)$
- **Answer**: $-4mn(2m + 3n)$

### Factorise $14p^3 - 21p^2 + 28p$

- The HCF of $14p^3$, $-21p^2$ and $28p$ is $7p$.
- Write $7p$ outside the brackets:
  - $7p( ? )$ (we don't yet know what's inside the brackets, or if it's plus or minus).
- Divide each term by $7p$ and write the results inside the brackets:
  - $\frac{14p^3}{7p} = 2p^2$
  - $\frac{-21p^2}{7p} = -3 p$
  - $\frac{28p}{7p} = 4$
- Write those results together inside the brackets:
  - $7p(2p^2 - 3p + 4)$
- **Answer**: $7p(2p^2 - 3p + 4)$
