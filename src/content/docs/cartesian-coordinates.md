## What are Cartesian coordinates?

- Cartesian coordinates are a way of writing a position on a graph.
- They're usually written as an ordered pair: (x, y).

## x and y coordinates

In coordinates expressed as $(x, y)$:
- The first number, $x$, is the horizontal position (left or right).
- The second number, $y$, is the vertical position (up or down).

### Find the x-coordinate of the point (4, 7)

- The x-coordinate is the first number in the pair.
- So: the x-coordinate of (4, 7) is 4.

### Find the y-coordinate of the point (8, 7)

- The y-coordinate is the second number in the pair.
- So: the y-coordinate of (4, 7) is 7.
