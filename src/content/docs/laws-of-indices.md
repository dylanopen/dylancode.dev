There are 7 main laws of indices you need to know. These tell us how to simplify
expressions when:

- [multiplying indices](/multiplying-indices)
- [dividing indices](/dividing-indices)
- [raising an index to an index](/raising-an-index-to-an-index)
- [power of 1](/power-of-1)
- [power of 0](/power-of-0)
- [fractional powers](/fractional-powers)
- [negative powers](/negative-powers)
