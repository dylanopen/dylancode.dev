title: Laws of indices
---

There are 7 main laws of indices you need to know. These regard:

- [multiplying indices](multiplying-indices)
- [dividing indices](dividing-indices)
- [raising an index to an index](raising-an-index-to-an-index)
- [power of 1](power-of-1)
- [power of 0](power-of-0)
- [fractional powers](fractional-powers)
- [negative powers](negative-powers)

## Dividing indices

When we divide two indices **with the same base**, we can simply **subtract**
the powers. This can be written as:

$$
a^x\div a^b=a^{x-y}
$$

### Example: simplify $x^3\div x^{-2}$

- $=x^{3--2}$
- $=x^{3+2}$
- $=x^5$

## Raising an index to an index

When we have a number, and we raise it to a power, then raise the result to the
power of another number, we **multiply** the powers. This is much more easily
shown using algebra:

$$
(a^x)^y=a^{xy}
$$

> Note: if $a^x$ above is **not** surrounded with brackets, then this does not
> work, as it is then the power itself that is being raised to the second power.

## Example: simplify $(a^4)^7$

- $=a^{4\times7}$
- $=a^{28}$

## Power of 1

Anything raised to the power of 1 is itself:

$$
a^1=a
$$

### Example: evaluate $17^1$

- $17$

## Power of 0

Anything raised to the power of zero is $1$:

$$
a^0=1
$$

## Example: evaluate $4^0$

- $1$

## Fractional powers

When we raise a number to a fraction, the **denominator** of the fraction is the
**order of the root**.

$$
a^{\frac xy}=(\sqrt[y]{a})^b
$$

## Example: evaluate $16^{\frac34}$

- $=(\sqrt[4]{16})^3$
- $=2^3$
- $=8$

## Negative powers

A negative power indicates the *reciprocal* of the base. For a power of $-1$:

$$
a^{-1}=\frac1a
$$

For a negative power other than $-1$, it indicates the reciprocal of the
fraction, but the order of the base remains. This can be shown as:

$$
a^{-x}=\frac1{a^x}
$$

### Example: evaluate $(\frac34)^{-1}$

- $=\frac1{(\frac34)}$
- $\frac43$

### Example: evaluate $(\frac73)^{-2}$

- $=\frac1{(\frac73)^{-2}}$
- $=(\frac37)^{2}$
- $=\frac9{49}$
