title: NAND gate
---

A *NAND gate* is a combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. In other
words, it's an inverted AND gate.

A NAND gate will output a `0` only when **both** of its input signals are `1`.
In all other cases, it will output a `1`.

## Truth table

| Input A | Input B | Output (A NAND B) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
|    0    |    0    |      **1**        |
|    0    |    1    |      **1**        |
|    1    |    0    |      **1**        |
|    1    |    1    |      **0**        |

> If the inputs are *not* both true.
