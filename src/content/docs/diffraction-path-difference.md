title: Diffraction path difference
---

## What happens during diffraction?

- When waves pass through two slits, they create two sets of waves which can
  interfere with each other.
- It creates a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes on the screen.
- The central bright fringe is the brightest, and the fringes get less bright as
  you move away from the centre.
- The bright fringes are equally spaced.

## How it works

- They interfere constructively when the peaks of both of the waves line up.
  - That happens when the [phase difference](/phase-difference) between the two
    waves is a multiple of $2\pi$, and when the
    [path difference](/path-difference) between the two waves is a multiple of
    one wavelength ($\lambda$).
  - The constructive interference creates the bright fringes.
- They interfere destructively when the peaks of one wave line up with the
  troughs of the other wave
  - That happens when the phase difference between the two waves is **not** a
    multiple of $2\pi$, and when the path difference between the two waves is
    **not** a multiple of one wavelength ($\lambda$).
  - It will produce **dark fringes** on the screen.
- The further away the fringe is from the centre, the **larger** the path
  difference is between the waves, and so the fringes will be less bright (for
  constructive interference).
