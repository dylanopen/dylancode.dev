title: Drag
---

*Drag* is a type of resistive force just like [friction](/friction), but it acts
in a *fluid* (a gas or a liquid) rather than on a solid surface.

The most common example is **air resistance**.

## Direction of action

Like friction, drag forces act in the *opposite* direction to the motion of an
object.

## When does drag occur?

Drag occurs when an object is moving through a fluid, causing a force which
opposes the motion of the object.

The reason it occurs is because the object has to 'push through' the fluid,
which is made up of lots of particles.  
Moving these particles out of the way 'uses up' some of the energy of the
object, which causes a force which opposes the motion of the object (e.g. it to
slow down).

Again, like friction, drag can only *oppose* an *existing* force or motion. It
can't *create* a force or motion on its own - so basically, it can only slow
down existing motion rather than actually make an object move.
