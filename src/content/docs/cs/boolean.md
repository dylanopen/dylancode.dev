title: Boolean
---

A *boolean* is a datatype which only has two possible states:
- `true`
- `false`

For example, we could use a boolean to represent whether a light switch is on or
off.

## Declaring and initializing booleans

We can use the `bool` class to declare and initialize boolean variables:

```cs
bool isLightOn = true;
bool isDoorOpen = false;
```

Remember that the only two possible values for a boolean are `true` and `false`:
we couldn't set `isLightOn` to `1` or `"yes"`, for example.

## Uses of booleans

Booleans are mainly used for *conditional statements* - for example, deciding
whether to execute a block of code or whether to repeat a loop, depending on a
boolean condition.

We'll cover that when we cover **if statements** and **loops** later on!
