title: Quadratic inequalities
---

*Quadratic inequalities* are inequalities that involve a quadratic expression.
For example: $5x^2 - 3x + 2 > 0$.

They're a little trickier to solve than regular quadratic equations, because
we need to find the *range* of values that satisfy the inequality, rather than
just specific values.

## The basic steps

A summary of the steps to solve quadratic inequalities is:
- Rearrange the inequality so that one side is zero (e.g., $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$)
- Solve the equation as if it were a normal quadratic equation
  ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)
- Sketch the graph of that equation
- Using the inequality sign, determine whether we are looking for the parts
  *above* the x-axis (for > or ≥) or *below* the x-axis (for < or ≤).
- Find the range of x values from the graph that would produce this.
- Write that as an inequality or in interval notation.

## Examples

### Example: Solve the inequality $x^2 - 4x + 3 < 0$.

- Treat this as a normal quadratic equation first:
  - $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$
  - $(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0$
  - So, $x = 1$ or $x = 3$.
- Sketch the graph of the inequality $x^2 - 4x + 3 < 0$:
  - \[I will draw the graph later when I have time\]
- Since the inequality is '<', we are looking for the parts of the graph
  that are *below* the x-axis.
- *Between* the roots, the y-values are negative (below the x-axis), and so we
  are looking for the range between the roots of $3$ and $1$.
- Finally, we write that as an inequality:
  - $1 < x < 3$

## Set notation

When writing the solution to a quadratic inequality, we can use set notation
to clearly express the range of values that satisfy the inequality.

For example, if we have solved the inequality $x^2 - 4x + 3 < 0$ and found
that the solution is $1 < x < 3$, we can express this in set notation as:
- $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 1 < x < 3 \}$
This reads as "the set of all real numbers x such that x is greater than 1 and
less than 3".

## Interval notation

  be fixed.

Another way to express the solution to a quadratic inequality is through
interval notation.

Using the same example of the inequality $x^2 - 4x + 3 < 0$ with the solution
$1 < x < 3$, we can express this in interval notation as:
- $(1, 3)$
This indicates that x can take any value between 1 and 3, but does not include
the endpoints 1 and 3 themselves (which is why we use parentheses instead of
brackets).

If the inequality were inclusive (e.g., $x^2 - 4x + 3 \leq 0$), the solution
would include the endpoints, and we would write it in interval notation as:
- $[1, 3]$
This indicates that x can take any value between 1 and 3, including the
endpoints 1 and 3 (which is why we use brackets).

Using set notation or interval notation helps to clearly communicate the
solution to quadratic inequalities in a concise manner, allowing for elaborate
sharing of mathematical ideas.
