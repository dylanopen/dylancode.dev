title: Estimation using rounding
---

If we are asked to *estimate* the answer to a calculation, we do the following
steps:

1. Round each number to one significant figure.
2. Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers.

## Examples

### Estimate $23.7 + 58.9 + 12.1$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $23.7$ rounds to $20$
  - $58.9$ rounds to $60$
  - $12.1$ rounds to $10$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $20 + 60 + 10 = 90$
- **Answer**: $90$

### Estimate $6.3 \times 4.2$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $6.3$ rounds to $6$
  - $4.2$ rounds to $4$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $6 \times 4 = 24$
- **Answer**: $24$

### Estimate $150 \div 7.8$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $150$ rounds to $200$
  - $7.8$ rounds to $8$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $200 \div 8 = 25$
- **Answer**: $25$

### Estimate $45.6 - 19.3$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $45.6$ rounds to $50$
  - $19.3$ rounds to $20$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $50 - 20 = 30$
- **Answer**: $30$


### Estimate $12.4 + 5.6 \times 3.2 - 8.9 \div 2.1$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $12.4$ rounds to $10$
  - $5.6$ rounds to $6$
  - $3.2$ rounds to $3$
  - $8.9$ rounds to $9$
  - $2.1$ rounds to $2$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $10 + 6 \times 3 - 9 \div 2$
  - $= 10 + 18 - 4.5$
  - $= 23.5$
- **Answer**: $23.5$

### Estimate $7.4^2 + 3.6^2$

- Round each number to one significant figure:
  - $7.4$ rounds to $7$
  - $3.6$ rounds to $4$
- Perform the calculation using the rounded numbers:
  - $7^2 + 4^2$
  - $= 49 + 16$
  - $= 65$
- **Answer**: $65$
