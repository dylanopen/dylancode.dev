title: Speed of electromagnetic wave
---

The speed of *any* electromagnetic (or EM) wave is around
$3.00\times10^8ms^{-1}$ in a vacuum.

## Wavelength and frequency changes

Because of our equation linking wavelength ($\lambda$), frequency ($f$) and
velocity ($v$):

$$
v=f\lambda
$$

We can re-arrange it to find the frequency, $f$:

$$
f=\frac v{\lambda}
$$

Or, to find the wavelength, $\lambda$:

$$
\lambda=\frac vf
$$

From this, we can tell that (if velocity remains constant):
- if the wavelength increases -> the frequency will decrease
- if the wavelength decreases -> the frequency will increase

Similarly:
- if the frequency increases -> the wavelength will decrease
- if the frequency decreases -> the wavelength will increase

> Again, this **only** works if velocity remains constant. With an EM wave, the
> velocity is always constant for any type of electromagnetic wave!
