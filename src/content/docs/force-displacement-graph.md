title: Force-displacement graph
---

A force-displacement graph measures:
- The force applied in newtons, $N$, on the y-axis
- The displacement in metres, $m$, on the x-axis

## Area under the graph

The area under a force-displacement graph gives the work done, in joules, $J$.

That's because $\text{Work done} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}$, and the
area under the graph is just the force multiplied by the distance (because the 
two axis multiply when finding the area).

### Units of the area

To find the area under the graph, we multiply the force (in newtons, $N$) by the
displacement (in metres, $m$).

That gives us newton-metres, $Nm$.

If we look at the SI units of newton-metres:
- $N = kg\,\,m/s^2$
- $Nm = kg\,\,m/s^2 \times m = kg\,\,m^2/s^2$

One *joule* is defined as $kg\,\,m^2/s^2$.

So the units are the same! That shows us that the area under the graph must
be in joules, $J$, so represents the work done (or energy transferred).
