title: Utility programs
---

- Utility programs are essentially system software which can help to manage the
  computer's resources.
- They're not strictly needed to run the computer, but they're often bundled in
  with the operating system to provide useful extra tools.

### Examples of utility programs

- File management tools (e.g. file explorers)
- Disk management tools (e.g. defragmenters)
- System monitoring tools (e.g. task managers)
- Backup tools (may be incremental or full)
- Antivirus software
- Compression tools (e.g. ZIP utilities)
