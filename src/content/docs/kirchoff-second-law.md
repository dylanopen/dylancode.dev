title: Kirchoff's second law
---

The algebraic sum of the EMFs is equal to the sum of potential differences
around a closed loop.

This essentially means that:
- the total EMF (voltage) supplied by the power source equals the total
  potential difference (voltage) across the components in the loop.

We can write this as:

$$
\sum \epsilon = \sum V
$$

### Example

In a simple circuit, a battery of EMF $12V$ is connected in series with two
resistors of resistance $2\Omega$ and $4\Omega$. Calculate the potential
difference across each resistor.
- Total resistance = $2\Omega + 4\Omega = 6\Omega$
- Total EMF = $12V$
  - so the total potential difference across the resistors must also be $12V$.
- $V=IR$
  - $V=12V$
  - $R=6\Omega$
  - $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{12V}{6\Omega}=2A$
- Potential difference across $2\Omega$ resistor:
  - $V=IR=2A \times 2\Omega=4V$
- Potential difference across $4\Omega$ resistor:
  - $V=IR=2A \times 4\Omega=8V$
