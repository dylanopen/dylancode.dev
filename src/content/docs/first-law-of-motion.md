title: First law of motion
---

Newton's first law of motion states that:

> A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line,
> unless it is acted upon by a force.

## What does this mean?

What this basically means is that:
- If an object isn't moving, it won't start moving unless a force is applied to
  it.
- If an object is moving, it won't change its velocity (speed or direction),
  again, unless a force is applied to it.
