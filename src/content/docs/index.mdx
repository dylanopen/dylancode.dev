## About dylancode.dev

I'm in college studying maths, physics and computing - so why not share the
things I learn with others?

This website aims to provide free (as in freedom) high-quality studying
resources for various different levels.

I created this website because as a private tutor, I realised the value of
effective tutoring and help in education. I'd like to help as many people as
possible through the years of their school, college, university and full-time
employment.

I hope our resources can help you!
