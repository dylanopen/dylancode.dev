## About dylancode.dev

I'm in college studying maths, physics and computing - so why not share the
things I learn with others?

This website aims to provide free (as in freedom) high-quality studying
resources for various different levels.

I created this website because as a private tutor, I realised the value of
effective tutoring and help in education. I'd like to help as many people as
possible through the years of their school, college, university and full-time
employment.

I hope our resources can help you!

## Navigating the site

All finished resources are listed in the sidebar to the left of the page,
organised by topic.

You can also use the search button at the top left of the sidebar (or ctrl+k) to
search for specific topics or keywords.

## What's there to see here?

I post guides on various things that I find interesting. For example:

- Maths resources, primarily for A-level but also some GCSE-level content
- Physics resources, also primarily for A-level but some GCSE-level content
- Programming language tutorials, including:
  - [C programming](/c/hello-world)
  - [C# programming](/cs/hello-world)
  - [RISC-V assembly](/riscv/smallest-program)
  - ...and *many* more to come in the future.
- Game server resources, including:
  - My [Minecraft server optimisation guide](/minecraft/optimisation)
  - A [PaperMC plugin coding tutorial series](/minecraft-plugin/project-setup)
