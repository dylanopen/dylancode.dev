title: Reflection of light

> Reflection is the change in direction of light when it bounces off a surface.

## Measuring the angle of a ray

There are two types of rays involved in reflection:
- An *incident ray* is the ray of light that hits the surface.
- A *reflected ray* is the ray of light that bounces off the surface.

To measure the angles of these rays, we also need to know about the *normal*:
- The *normal* is an imaginary line that is perpendicular (at 90°) to the
  surface where the light ray hits.

## Laws of reflection

- The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
- This means that the angle at which the light ray hits the surface is the same
  as the angle at which it bounces off.
- Both the incident ray and the reflected ray are on the same side of the
  normal.
