title: Simple binary operators
---

- A binary operator is simply any operator in maths which takes two inputs and
  produces an output.
- Usually, there's a symbol representing the operator, placed between the two
  inputs.

## Examples of binary operators

- Addition (`+`): Takes two numbers and produces their sum.
  - Example: `3 + 5 = 8`
- Subtraction (`-`): Takes two numbers and produces their difference.
  - Example: `10 - 4 = 6`
- Multiplication (`*`): Takes two numbers and produces their product.
  - Example: `6 * 7 = 42$
- Division (`/`): Takes two numbers and produces their *quotient* ('what they
  divide to make').
  - Example: `20 / 4 = 5`
- Exponentiation/powers (`^` or `**`): Takes a base number and an exponent,
  producing the base raised to the power of the exponent.
  - Example: `2^3 = 8` (2 raised to the power of 3)
- Modulus (`%`): Takes two numbers and produces the remainder of the division
  - Example: `10 % 3 = 1` (10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1)

## Sets

- The input values come from an initial set, call it $S$.
- IF the output value is also always in the same set $S$, then we say that the
  set is *closed* under that operation.
- $S$ doesn't have to be a finite set, just needs to be defined *somehow*.
  - For example, the set of integers ($\mathbb{Z}$) is closed under addition,
    subtraction, and multiplication, but not division (e.g. `1 / 2` is not an
    integer).
