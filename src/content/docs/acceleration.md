title: Acceleration
---

> Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

It's basically how quickly something speeds up.

Because it's the rate of change of [velocity](/velocity), it's a
[vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

## $\text{acceleration}=\text{velocity}\div\text{time}$

$$
v=at
$$

$$
a=\frac vt
$$

## Calculations

### The velocity of a car increases from $10ms^{-1}$ to $30ms^{-1}$ in 4s. Calculate its acceleration.

- In this case we need to use the *change in velocity*, $\Delta v$.
- $\Delta v=30-10=20$
- $a=\frac{\Delta v}t$
- $a=\frac{20}4=5$
- Answer: $5ms^{-1}$

### A car accelerates at $2ms^{-2}$ for 5s. Calculate the change in velocity.

- $a=\frac{\Delta v}t$
- $\Delta v=at$
- $\Delta v=2\times5=10$
- Answer: $10ms^{-1}$

### A bike accelerates at $0.5ms^{-2}$ for 10s. Calculate the change in velocity.

- $a=\frac{\Delta v}t$
- $\Delta v=at$
- $\Delta v=0.5\times10=5$
- Answer: $5ms^{-1}$

### A car accelerates at $3ms^{-2}$ until reaching a velocity of $20ms^{-1}$. Calculate the time taken to reach this velocity.

- $a=\frac vt$
- $t=\frac v a$
- $t=\frac{20}3\approx6.67$
- Answer: $6.67s$
