title: Matrix definition
---

- A *matrix* is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions,
  arranged in rows and columns.
- Basically, it's a 2D grid of values.

## Examples of matrices

3x3 matrix of numbers:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$

2x2 matrix of variables:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Order of a matrix

- The *order* is the number of rows and columns in a matrix.
- It is written as `m x n`, where:
  - `m` = number of rows
  - `n` = number of columns
- For example, a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns has an order of `3 x 4`.

## Matrix notation

A matrix is a table of values written in square brackets or parentheses - `[]`
or `()`.

We usually represent a variable that holds a matrix with a capital \[and bold\]
letter, e.g. **A**, **B**, or **M**.
