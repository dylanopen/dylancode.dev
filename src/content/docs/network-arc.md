title: Network arc
---

An *arc* on a network is the equivalent of an [edge](/graph-edge) in a
[graph](/graph).

It connects two [nodes](/network-node) in the network, representing a
relationship or interaction between them.

## Weight

The important distinction between an arc and a simple edge is that an arc can
have a *weight* associated with it.

This weight is a number which represents the *strength* of the connection.

It could, for example, represent:
- The *capacity* of a road in a transportation network (e.g. how many vehicles
  can travel along it per hour).
- The *cost* of sending a parcel along a delivery route.
- The amount of water that can flow through a pipe in a water supply network.
- The distance between two vertices (e.g. towns).

## Directed vs undirected arcs

Arcs can be either *directed* or *undirected*:
- A *directed* arc can only be traversed in one direction.
- An *undirected* arc can be traversed in both directions.
