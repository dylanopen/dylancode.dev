title: Conservation of energy
---

The principle of conservation of energy basically states that:

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one
> form to another.

What that really means is that the total amount of energy in a system is always
the same, even if the energy is transferred from one form to another.

## Why does it seem like things lose and gain energy?

When we see things losing and gaining energy, it's because the energy is being
transferred from one form to another. For example, when a car slows down, it
seems like it's losing energy, but really the kinetic energy of the car is being
transferred to other forms of energy, such as heat energy in the brakes.

## A car driving through space

Theoretically, in space, there are no [resistive forces](/friction) such as
friction or air resistance, so a car that starts moving will keep moving
at that same speed forever - even without accelerating!

Similarly, when braking, we're *adding friction* to the system in order to
transfer some of the kinetic energy of the car to heat energy in the brakes,
which is why the car slows down.
