title: Expanding single brackets
---

### Example: Expand $3(2x + 5)$ using the grid method

Draw a grid with one row and two columns, since we have one term outside the
brackets ($3$) and two terms inside the brackets ($2x$ and $5$):

| $\times$ | $2x$ | $2x$ |
|----------|------|------|
| $3$      |      |      |

Although it's not necessary to write the multiplication sign in the top-left
it can help remind us that we are multiplying each row term by each column term.

Now, multiply each term inside the brackets by the term outside the brackets:

| $\times$ | $2x$    | $5$     |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $3$      | $6x$    | $15$    |

Add the terms in the middle of the grid together to get the final answer:
- Answer: $6x + 15$
