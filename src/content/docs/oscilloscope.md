## Scale of an oscilloscope

An oscilloscope has two axes:
- The horizontal axis shows *time* (in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds,
  etc).
- The vertical axis shows *voltage*, or *potential difference* (in volts,
  millivolts, etc).

The scale of the oscilloscope tells us how much each *division* (box) on the
axis represents.

For example, if the time scale is set to `0.5 ms/div`, then each division (box)
on the horizontal axis represents `0.5 milliseconds`.

If the voltage scale is set to `2 V/div`, then each division (box) on the
vertical axis represents `2 volts`.

## Amplitude

The *amplitude* of a wave can be found from an oscilliscope plot. It's the
distance from the centre line, to the peak (or trough) of a wave (the highest or
lowest point).

## Period

We can find the *period* of a wave from an oscilloscope plot. The period is the
time taken for one complete cycle of the wave.

To find it, we can measure the distance (in seconds) between two consecutive
peaks (or troughs) of the wave.

## Frequency

We can calculate the frequency using the formula:

$$
f=\frac1T
$$

Where:
- $f$ is the frequency (in hertz, Hz)
- $T$ is the period (in seconds, s)

For example, if the period of a wave is `0.01 seconds`, then the frequency is:

$$
f=\frac1{0.01}=100\text{ Hz}
$$
