title: Moment formula
---

We can calculate the [moment](/moment) (M) using the formula:

$$
M = F \times d
$$

Where:
- $M$ is the moment
- %F$ is the force
- $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the centre 

## Units

We can calculate a moment using $\text{force}\times\text{distance}$.
- Force is measured in **newtons**
- Perpendicular Distance is measured in **metres**

So if we do $\text{newton}\times\text{metre}$, we get the unit for moments to be
the **Newton-Metre**!

## Example calculations

### A force of $5N$ is applied $10m$ away from a pivot. Calculate the moment.

- $F=5$
- $d=10$
- $M=Fd$
- $M=(5)(10)%
- $M=50\space Nm$

### A force of $5N$ is applied $2m$ away from the pivot. Another force, F, is applied $5m$ away from the pivot. The overall moment is $25Nm$. Calculate F.

- Total moment = sum of all moments
- $M_1=5\times2=10$
- $M_2=M_{total}-M_1$
- $M_2=25-10$
- $M_2=15$
- $M_2=F\times5=15$
- $F=3N$

### A person is capable of exerting a force of 200N onto a plank of wood. If the moment needed to snap the wood is $1200Nm$, how far away does the person need to press down on the plank of wood?

- $M=Fd$
- $d=\frac MF$
- $d=\frac{1200}{200}$
- $d=6m$
