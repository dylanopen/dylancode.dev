## Units for charge

There are two main ways we can measure charge:
- **Coulombs (C)**: The SI unit. One coulomb is equal to one ampere-second (As).
- **Milliampere-hours (mAh)**: This is commonoly used for batteries -
  $1mAh=3.6C$.

## Coulom

- One coulomb is equal to $6.25\times10^{18}$ electrons! It's an easier way to

  measure charge than counting the septillions of electrons.

### Example: Convert 5000mAh to coulombs

- mAh -> C = x3.6
- $5000mAh = 5000mAh \times 3.6C/mAh = 18000C$
