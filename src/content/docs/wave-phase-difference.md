title: Wave phase difference
---

We can describe the position of a wave using an angle: that's called the *phase*
of the wave.

The start of the wave is at $0$ radians.

The next full cycle of the wave happens at $2\pi$ radians ($360\degree$).

This means that the [phase difference](wave-phase-difference) between two peaks,
troughs or wave cycles is $2\pi$ radians ($360\degree$).

## Phase and antiphase

- If the *phase difference* between two points on a wave is $2\pi$ radians:
  - the points are **in phase**
  - the points are doing exactly the same thing

- If the *phase difference* between two points on a wave is $\pi$ radians:
  - the points are in *antiphase*
  - the points are doing opposite things

## Moving one wave by half a wavelength

If we move along a wave by half a wavelength, we move by a phase difference of
$\pi$ radians.

This means that if we start at a peak, and move half a wavelength along the
wave, we'll end up at a trough, for example.

- If the waves were previously *in phase*, they will now be in *antiphase*.
- If the waves were previously in *antiphase*, they will now be *in phase*.
