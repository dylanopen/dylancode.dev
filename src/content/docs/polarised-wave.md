title: Polarised wave
---

A *polarised wave* is a transverse wave where the oscillations (vibrations)
occur in a **single plane or direction**.

This becomes easier to think about if you use the example of a light wave:
- normally, a light will have oscillations occurring in multiple planes (in lots
  of different directions).
- but when the light is polarised, the oscillations only travel in one plane
  (in one specific direction).

So, some definitions:
- **Polarised wave**: a transverse wave where the oscillations occur in a single
  plane or direction.
- **Unpolarised wave**: a transverse wave where the oscillations occur in
  multiple planes or directions.

## Longitudinal waves and polarisation

Longitudinal waves **cannot** be polarised. This is because the oscillations in
a longitudinal wave occur in the same direction as the wave is travelling, so
there is no other plane or direction for the oscillations to occur in.

This is actually a useful property, because it means we can tell apart
transverse and longitudinal waves by checking whether they can be polarised or
not.
