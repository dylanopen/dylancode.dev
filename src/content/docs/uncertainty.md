title: Uncertainty
---

The *uncertainty* of a measurement is a way of telling us how [precise](/precision)
that measurement is.

It basically says 'how far off could our measurement be from the actual value?'

## Representing uncertainty

We can represent uncertainty in two main ways:
- Absolute uncertainty
- Percentage uncertainty

## Absolute uncertainty

To calculate the absolute uncertainty of a set of measurements, we can use the
formula:

$$
\text{absolute uncertainty} = \frac{\text{range}}{2}
$$

Absolute uncertainty can be written like this:

$$
\text{mean} \pm \text{absolute uncertainty}
$$

For example, $5.0cm \pm 0.1cm$ means the actual value could be anywhere between
$4.9cm$ and $5.1cm$ (0.1cm above or below 5.0cm).

### Find the absolute uncertainty of the measurements 5.1cm, 5.3cm, 5.2cm, and 5.4cm

- Range: $5.4cm - 5.1cm = 0.3cm$
- Absolute uncertainty: $\frac{0.3cm}{2} = 0.15cm$
- Absolute uncertainty = $\pm0.15cm$

If we wanted to express it with the average measurement, we would do:
- Mean = $(5.1cm + 5.3cm + 5.2cm + 5.4cm)\div4 = 5.25cm$
- Measurement with uncertainty = $5.25cm \pm 0.15cm$

## Percentage uncertainty

Percentage uncertainty basically tells us 'what percentage of the measurement 
could we be off by?'

For example, if we have a measurement of $10cm \pm 1cm$, that means we could be
off by $1cm$. To find the percentage uncertainty, we can use the formula:

$$
\text{percentage uncertainty} = \left(\frac{\text{absolute uncertainty}}{\text{measurement}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

For example, to find the percentage uncertainty of our absolute uncertainty
example above ($5.25cm \pm 0.15cm$):

$$
\text{percentage uncertainty} = \left(\frac{0.15cm}{5.25cm}\right) \times 100\% \approx 2.86\%
$$
