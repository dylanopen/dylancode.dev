title: Complex conjugate
---

A **complex conjugate pair** is a pair of two complex numbers which are
identical, except for that the sign of the imaginary part is different.

If $w=x+yi$, then the conjugate of $w$ is $x-yi$.

## Representing the complex conjugate

The complex conjugate of a complex number, $z$, is represented by $z^*$.

## Examples of complex conjugates

- $5+2i$ and $5-2i$
- $-i+1$ and $1+i$
- $4i$ and $-4i$

## Complex roots

Complex roots come in conjugate pairs. This means that, if a complex number is
a root of an equation, then the conjugate of that complex number is also a root.

### Given that $5+4i$ is a root of an equation, find another root

- $5-4i$
