## What is a composite number?

A composite number is any number which has **more than** two factors.

## Examples of composite numbers

- $4$ (factors: $1$, $2$, $4$)
- $6$ (factors: $1$, $2$, $3$, $6$)
- $9$ (factors: $1$, $3$, $9$)
- $15$ (factors: $1$, $3$, $5$, $15$)
- $100$ (factors: $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $25$, $50$, $100$)

## Non-examples of composite numbers

- $2$ (factors: $1$, $2$) - only two factors, so it is prime
- $3$ (factors: $1$, $3$) - only two factors, so it is prime
- $5$ (factors: $1$, $5$) - only two factors, so it is prime
- $29$ (factors: $1$, $29$) - only two factors, so it is prime
- $97$ (factors: $1$, $97$) - only two factors, so it is prime
- $1$ (factors: $1$) - only one factor, so it is neither prime nor composite

## [Prime numbers](prime-numbers)

You may think that all non-composite numbers are prime numbers, and you'd be
right... usually.

The number $1$ has only one factor: $1$, so it is *not* composite because it
does not have more than 2 factors.  
It is also not prime, because prime numbers have **exactly** 2 factors.
