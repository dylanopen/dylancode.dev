title: Precision
---

If we measure results in an experiment, one of the things we need to consider is
how *precise* our measurements are.

> Precision is how close multiple measurements are to each other.

For example, if we measure the length of a table three times and get 2.00m,
2.01m, and 1.99m, those measurements are very precise because they are all very
close to each other.

However, if we measure the same table three times and get 2.00m, 2.50m, and
1.50m, those measurements are not very precise because they are all over the
place.

## Significant figures

Sometimes we can write the precision of a measurement using *significant
figures*. essentially, we look at all our non-anomalous results, and we see
what the most precise number is that all our results will round to.

If we have these results from measuring the time taken for a reaction to occur:
- 12.38s
- 12.36s
- 12.35s

Then we can round the results:
- All of the round to 10s
- All of them round to 12s
- All of them round to 12.4s
- However, their *fourth* significant figure is different (8, 6, and 5) so we
  can't round any further.
- Our results are precise to *three significant figures*.

## Uncertainty

Another way we can measure precision is using [uncertainty: see here](/uncertainty).
