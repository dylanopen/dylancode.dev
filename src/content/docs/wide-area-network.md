title: Wide area network
---

A *wide area newtwork* is kind of the opposite of a
[local area network](/local-area-network).

It's a network that covers a large geographical area. For example, the internet
is a WAN because it covers the whole world.

## Making up a WAN

a wide area network is really just a bunch of different local area networks that
are all connected together.

The internet is just a group of loads of [local area networks](/local-area-network)
that are all connected together, and so can all communicate with each other.

## How do they connect together?

To connect multiple LANs together to make up a WAN, we can use a
[router](/router) to connect the different LANs together.

The router can route traffic between the different LANs (across a WAN like the
internet) so that devices on one LAN can communicate with devices on another
LAN.

## Transmission medium

The *transmission medium* is just the wires (or another way) that the routers
can use to communicate with each other.

- For long-distance communication, we usually use fibre-optic cables, which can
  transmti data really quickly over long distances without losing much of the
  signal.
- For shorter distances, we can use things like copper cables. They're much
  slower and can be more prone to [network interference](/network-interference)
  than fibre-optic cables, but they can be cheaper in the short-term.
- We can also use wireless communication, such as radio waves, to connect
  different LANs together. Wireless communication is often *wayy* slower than
  using cables.
- *Coaxial* cables are really old. They're the same cables that are used to
  connect landline phones - but they can still be used in some cases to connect
  to the internet. That said, you would be stuck with ***dial-up speeds...***
