title: Calculating the number of electrons
---

When calculating the number of electrons, you're really calculating the *charge*
(because charge is just a multiple of the number of electrons).

## Charge of a single electron

The charge of a single electron is about $-1.60\times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

Similarly a coulomb has the same charge as $6.25\times 10^{18}$ electrons.

## Equation for the number of electrons in a charge

$$
n=\frac Qe
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the number of electrons
- $Q$ is the total charge in coulombs
- $e$ is the charge of a single electron ($1.60\times 10^{-19}C$)

## Example: if $0.032C$ flows into a motoro in $0.20s$, calculate the current flow

- $Q=It$
- $0.032C=I\times 0.20s$
- $I=\frac{0.032C}{0.20s}$
- $I=0.16A$

## Estimate the number of electrons flowing in $20s$ if a current of $25mA$ flows

- $I=25mA=0.025A$
- $t=20s$
- $Q=It$
- $Q=0.025A\times 20s$
- $Q=0.50C$
- $n=\frac Qe$
- $n=\frac{0.50C}{1.60\times 10^{-19}C}$
- $n=3.1\times 10^{18}$ electrons
