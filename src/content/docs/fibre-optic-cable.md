title: Fibre optic cable

A fibre optic cable is a long stretch of thin glass.

It's used to transmit information - e.g. in the internet.

## How it works

- The angle of incidence of each transmitted pulse of light must be *greater
  than* the [critical angle](/total-internal-reflection).
- When light hits the edge of the fibre, it reflects. That's because the angle
  is more than the critical angle, and so **total internal reflection** occurs.
- It's *not* a 'mirror', but does still reflect (almost) all light.

- [Material dispersion](/fibre-optic-material-dispersion)
