title: Fibre optic cable
---

A fibre optic cable is a long stretch of thin glass.

It's used to transmit information - e.g. in the internet.

## How it works

- The angle of incidence of each transmitted pulse of light must be *greater
  than* the [critical angle](/total-internal-reflection).
- When light hits the edge of the fibre, it reflects. That's because the angle
  is more than the critical angle, and so **total internal reflection** occurs.
- It's *not* a 'mirror', but does still reflect (almost) all light.

## Parts of a fibre-optic cable

- The **core** (the middle bit) has the highest refractive index
- The **cladding** (outside) has a *slightly* lower refractive index than the
  core (but still higher than air)
- The air around the cable has the lowest refractive index, around $1$.
