title: Graph walk
---

A *walk* of a [graph](/graph) is a sequence of vertices such that each adjacent
pair of vertices in the sequence is connected by an edge in the graph.

This is a fancy way of saying that a walk is just a line you can draw on the
graph without lifting your pen from the paper.

## Visiting vertices and edges

- You can visit the same vertex multiple times in a walk.
- You can also traverse the same edge multiple times.
