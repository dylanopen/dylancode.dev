title: Conservation of momentum
---

The conservation of momentum simply states that:

> The total momentum of a closed system stays the same, even after a collision.

## What does this mean?

When multiple objects collide, the momentum of each object may change, but the
total momentum of all the objects combined will remain the same.

## Vectors

Remember that momentum is a [vector quantity](/vector-quantity).

If two objects are moving in opposite directions, towards each other, then
collide, their momentums before the collision may be, for example:
- Object A: $+5 \, kgms^{-1}$
- Object B: $-3 \, kgms^{-1}$

The total momentum before the collision is: $+5 + (-3) = +2 \, kgms^{-1}$

So the momentum of the two objects after the collision must also add up to
$+2 \, kgms^{-1}$, even if the momentum of each individual object changes.
