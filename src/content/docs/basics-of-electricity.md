## Electrical circuit

- An electrical circuit is an **energy delivery system**.
- It takes energy from the cell/battery and 'drops it off' at the components
  (such as the bulb).

## Summary of the 4 main quantities

These are explained much more over the next few pages, but here is a summary:

| Quantity            | Symbol | Unit        | Unit Symbol | Definition                                                 |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Charge              | $Q$    | Coulomb     | $C$         | (no simple definition) - 1C = $6.25\times10^{18} electrons |
| Current             | $I$    | Ampere      | $A$         | Rate of flow of charge                                     |
| Potential difference| $V$    | Volt        | $V$         | Work done per coulomb charge                               |
| Resistance          | $R$    | Ohm         | $\Omega$    | Opposition to current flow, ratio of p.d. to current       |
