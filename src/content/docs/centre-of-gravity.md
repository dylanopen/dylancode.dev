title: Centre of gravity
---

The *centre of gravity* of an object is basically where all its weight acts, or
where all the mass is acting.

## Moments around the centre of gravity

The moments need to add so that the resultant moment is **zero**.

Basically, the clockwise moments need to equal the anticlockwise moments.

## Formula

Because both moments must be equal, we can describe two objects of $W$ weight
and $d$ distance from the centre of gravity:

$$
W_1d_1=W_2d_2
$$
