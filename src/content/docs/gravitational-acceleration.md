title: Gravitational acceleration
---

If an object is dropped, it will *accelerate* towards the ground.

This is because of *gravity*. The force of gravity is known as the **weight** of
the object.

## Earth's acceleration due to gravity

When an object is dropped in *Earth's* gravitational field, it will accelerate
towards the ground at about $9.81ms^{-2}$.

That's known as the *acceleration due to gravity*. We write it with a $g$.

$$
g=9.81ms^{-2}
$$

## Resistive forces

In the real world, the objects falling to the ground won't always accelerate
at $9.81ms^{-2}$. THat's because there are some *resistive forces* which act
against the force of gravity - this decelerates the object. 

Generally, this is due to *air resistance* - the faster the object falls, the
more air resistance it experiences, and the more it decelerates.

It can also be another form of [drag](/drag) - for example, a ball falling
through water will experience [drag](/drag) from the water, which will
decelerate it.

If these resistive forces eventually become equal to the force of gravity, the
object will stop accelerating as it will be at
[terminal velocity](/terminal-velocity).
