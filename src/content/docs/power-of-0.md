title: Power of 0
---

Anything raised to the power of zero is $1$:

$$
a^0=1
$$

### Example: evaluate $4^0$

- $1$

### Example: evaluate $100^0$

- $1$

### Example: evaluate $x^0$

- $1$

### Example: solve for $n$: $5^n=1$

- Anything to the power of $0$ is $1$...
- so $n=0$

### Example: solve for $m$: $b^m=1$

- Anything to the power of $0$ is $1$...
- so $m=0$

### Example: find the possible values for $n$ and state when they apply: $k^n=1$

- If $k=1$, then $n$ can be *any* real number.
- If $k\ne1$, then $n=0$
