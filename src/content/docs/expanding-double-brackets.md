title: Expanding double brackets
---

### Example: Expand $(x - 4)(x - 2)$ using the grid method

Draw a grid with two rows and two columns, since we have two terms in each
set of brackets:

| $\times$ | $x$     | $-2$    |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $x$      |         |         |
| $-4$     |         |         |

Now, multiply each term in the first set of brackets by each term in the
second set of brackets (with the grid method, this is as simple as filling in
each box by multiplying the row and column headers):

| $\times$ | $x$     | $-2$    |
|----------|---------|---------|
| $x$      | $x^2$   | $-2x$   |
| $-4$     | $-4x$   | $8$     |

> Remember: The $-2$ and $-4$ headers multiply to give ***positive*** $8$,

Add the terms in the middle of the grid together to get the final answer:
- $x^2-4x-2x+8$
- Answer: $x^2 - 6x + 8$
