title: Diffraction grating
---

*DIffraction grating* is when we have a lot of tiny slits (openings) close to
each other in a material, and we send waves through those slits.

When the waves pass through the slits, they diffract (spread out) and overlap
with each other

This creates a pattern of bright and dark spots on a screen placed behind the
grating. This is because of the *interference* of the waves - where the waves
overlap, they can either add together (constructive) or cancel out
(destructive).

## Formula

The formula for diffraction grating is:

$$
n \lambda = d \sin \theta
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the *order of the spectrum* (or maximum).
- $\lambda$ is the *wavelength* of the wave.
- $d$ is the *distance between the slits* (also called the grating spacing).
- $\theta$ is the *angle* between the central maximum and the nth maximum.
