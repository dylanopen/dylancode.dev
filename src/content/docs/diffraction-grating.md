title: Diffraction grating
---

*DIffraction grating* is when we have a lot of tiny slits (openings) close to
each other in a material, and we send waves through those slits.

When the waves pass through the slits, they diffract (spread out) and overlap
with each other

This creates a pattern of bright and dark spots on a screen placed behind the
grating. This is because of the *interference* of the waves - where the waves
overlap, they can either add together (constructive) or cancel out
(destructive).

## Formula

The formula for diffraction grating is:

$$
n \lambda = d \sin \theta
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the *order of the spectrum* (or maximum).
- $\lambda$ is the *wavelength* of the wave.
- $d$ is the *distance between the slits* (also called the grating spacing).
- $\theta$ is the *angle* between the central maximum and the nth maximum.

## Order of diffraction fringes

The *order* tells you how far the fringe we're looking at is from the centre
line. For example, a fringe 3 away from the centre line has an order of $3$.

## Converting 'lines per millimetre' to 'distance between slits'

If we know the *number of lines* that are in one millimetre of the diffraction
grating, we can find the distance *between* the slits by doing:

$$
\text{distance}=\frac1{\text{lines per millimetre}}
$$

That gives you an answer in millimetres, so 

## Finding the highest order

Just make $\theta=90\degree$, and then rearrange and solve for $n$!

$$
n=\frac{d\sin\theta}{\lambda}
$$

### Given a grating with 400 lines per millimetre, how many orders can be produced on each side with an EM wave of wavelength 700nm?

- $d=\frac1{400}=2.5\times10^{-3}mm$
- $d=2.5\times10^{-6}m$
- $\lambda=7\times10^{-7}m$
- Let $\theta=90\degree$:
  - $\sin\theta=1$
- Rearrange the normal equation to find $n$ on its own:
  - $n=\frac{d\sin\theta}{\lambda}$
- Substitute the values and solve!
  - $n=\frac{2.5\times10^{-6}\times1}{700}$
  - $n\approx3.57\times10^{-9}$
