title: Impulse
---

*Impulse* is the change in momentum of an object when a force is applied to it
for a certain amount of time.

In short:
> Impulse is the change in momentum.

## Impulse equation

The equation for impulse is:    

$$
\text{Impulse} = \text{Force} \times \text{time}
$$

$$
\text{Impulse} = F \times t
$$

Where:
- $\text{Impulse}$ is the change in momentum of the object in kilogram meters
  per second
  ($kgms^{-1}$)
- $F$ is the force applied to the object in newtons ($N$)
- $t$ is the time for which the force is applied in seconds ($s$)
