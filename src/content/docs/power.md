> **Power** is the rate of energy transfer.

## What does rate mean?

WHenever we have a *rate* of something, it means 'how much happens in a certain
time'?

For a 'unit rate' of something, it means 'how much happens in one second'.

It therefore also means that the *units* area going to be 'something per second'
(e.g. joules per second, $J/s$).

## Formula

We can calculate power using the formula:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy transferred}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

Or, in symbols:

> $$
> P = \frac{E}{t}
> $$

Where:
- $P$ is the power, in watts, $W$
- $E$ is the energy transferred, in joules, $J$
- $t$ is the time taken, in seconds, $s$

## Rearranged versions

To calculate energy transferred:
- $\text{Energy transferred} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time taken}$
- $E = Pt$

To calculate time taken:
- $\text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Energy transferred}}{\text{Power}}$
- $t = \frac{E}{P}$

## Examples

### A heater is rated at a power of 2000 W. How much energy does it transfer in 30 minutes?

- $P = 2000\,W$
- $t = 30\,\text{minutes} = 30 \times 60\,s = 1800\,s$
- $E = Pt$
- $E = 2000\,W \times 1800\,s$
- $E = 3,600,000\,J$

### A machine transfers 5000 J of energy in 10 s. What is the power of the machine?

- $E = 5000\,J$
- $t = 10\,s$
- $P = \frac{E}{t}$
- $P = \frac{5000\,J}{10\,s}$
- $P = 500\,W$

### A machine has a power of 100 W and transfers 2000 J of energy. How long does it take to transfer the energy?

- $P = 100\,W$
- $E = 2000\,J$
- $t = \frac{E}{P}$
- $t = \frac{2000\,J}{100\,W}$
- $t = 20\,s$
