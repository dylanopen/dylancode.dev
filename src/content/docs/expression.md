title: Expression
---

An *algebraic expression* is a set of numbers, variables, and operations (like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) combined together to
represent a value.

The most important thing to remember is that it *does not* contain an equals
sign or an inequality sign.

### Examples of expressions

- $3x + 5$
- $2a^2 - 4b + 7$
- $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + 3$

### Non-examples of expressions

- $x = 5$ (this is an equation, not an expression)
- $y > 10$ (this is an inequality, not an expression)
- $4 \times$ (this is incomplete and not a valid expression)

## Terms

A *term* is a single number or variable, or numbers and variables multiplied
together. They're separated by addition or subtraction signs.

For example, in the expression $3x^2 + 5y - 7$, there are three terms:
- $3x^2$
- $5y$
- $-7$

## Coefficients

A *coefficient* is the *constant& part of a term that multiplies a variable.

For example, in the term $4x^3$, the coefficient is $4$, meaning that $x^3$ is
multiplied by $4$.

## Constants

A *constant* is a term that does not contain any variables. It is simply a fixed
number.

For example, in the expression $2x + 3$, the constant is $3$.

## Example problems

### Apples weigh a mass of $a$ and bananas weigh a mass of $b$. Write an expression for the total mass of 3 apples and 4 bananas.

- The mass of 3 apples is $3\cdot a=3a$.
- The mass of 4 bananas is $4\cdot b=4b$.
- $3a + 4b$ represents the total mass of 3 apples and 4 bananas.
