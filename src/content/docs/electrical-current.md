title: Electrical current
---

- Current is the **rate of flow of charge**.
- The symbol for current is $I$.
- The unit of current is the **ampere** ($A$).
- 1 ampere is equal to 1 coulomb of charge passing through a point in 1 second.
- The current can be measured using an ammeter.

### Current equation - charge and time

$$
\text{current} = \frac{\text{change in charge}}{\text{change in time}}
$$

$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$

### Current equation - voltage and resistance

$$
\text{current} = \frac{\text{voltage}}{\text{resistance}}
$$

$$
I=\frac{V}{R}
$$
