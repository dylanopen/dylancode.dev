title: Sector area from radians
---

We can calculate the area of a sector if we know the:
- radius of the circle
- angle of the sector (in radians)

## The equation

$$
A=\frac12\theta r^2
$$

- $A$ is the area of the sector
- $\theta$ is the angle of the sector
- $r$ is the radius of the circle

## Finding the angle of the sector

We can rearrange $A=\frac12\theta r^2$ into:

$$
\theta=\frac{2A}{r^2}
$$

## Finding the radius of the circle

We can also rearrange $A=\frac12\theta r^2$ into:

$$
r=\sqrt{\frac{2A}{\theta}}
$$
