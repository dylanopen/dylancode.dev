title: Inverse proportion
---

If two variables are inversely proportional to each other, it means that if
one of the variables *doubles*, for example, the other variable will be
*halved*.

In other words, the ***product*** of the two variables remains
**constant**.

Importantly, if $x$ is inversely proportional to $y$, then $y$ is also
inversely proportional to $x$. $y$ is equal to a constant divided by $x$, and
$x$ is equal to a constant divided by $y$.

## Expressing inverse proportion

- If $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$, we can write this as:
  - $x \propto \frac{1}{y}$
- Because $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$, it must be equal to a constant
  divided by $x$:
  - $y = \frac{k}{x}$
  - where $k$ is the *constant of proportionality*.
- Similarly, because $x$ is inversely proportional to $y$, it must be equal
  to a constant divided by $y$:
  - $x = \frac{k}{y}$
  - where $k$ is the constant of proportionality in this case.

### Proof

We can show that the inverse proportion can be expressed as $y = \frac{k}{x}$
using the rule stated above that $xy$ is always constant in inverse 
proportion.

- If $xy$ is constant, we can call this constant $k$:
  - $xy = k$
- Rearrange to make $y$ the subject:
  - $y = \frac{k}{x}$
- This shows we can express inverse proportion as $y = \frac{k}{x}$.

### $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$. Write $b$ as an equation in terms of $a$ and the constant of proportionality $k$.

- $a\propto \frac{1}{b}$
- $b = \frac{k}{a}$
- **Answer:** $b = \frac{k}{a}$

### $y$ is inversely proportional to $x^2$. Write $y$ as an equation in terms of $x$ and the constant of proportionality $k$.

- $y \propto \frac{1}{x^2}$
- $y = \frac{k}{x^2}$
- **Answer:** $y = \frac{k}{x^2}$

## Finding the constant of proportionality

In a question, you will likely be given a pair of values for the two variables
that are inversely proportional to each other. You can use these values to
find the constant of proportionality - just by substituting them into the
equation $y = \frac{k}{x}$, if $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$.

### $y\propto \frac{1}{x}$. When $x = 4$, $y = 10$. Find the constant of proportionality.

- $y = \frac{k}{x}$
- Substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 10$:
  - $10 = \frac{k}{4}$
- Rearranging to find $k$:
  - $k = 10 \times 4 = 40$
- **Answer:** $k = 40$

### $a\propto \frac{1}{b}$. When $b = 12$, $a = 3$. Find the constant of proportionality.

- $a = \frac{k}{b}$
- Substitute $b = 12$ and $a = 3$:
  - $3 = \frac{k}{12}$
- Rearranging to find $k$:
  - $k = 3 \times 12 = 36$
- **Answer:** $k = 36$

## Using inverse proportion to find unknown values

Once you have found the constant of proportionality, you can use it to find
unknown values of either variable.

### $y\propto \frac{1}{x}$. The constant of proportionality is $24$. Find $y$ when $x = 6$.

- $y = \frac{k}{x}$
- Substitute $k = 24$ and $x = 6$:
  - $y = \frac{24}{6}$
- Calculating $y$:
  - $y = 4$
- **Answer:** $y = 4$

### $a\propto \frac{1}{b}$. When $b = 8$, $a = 5$. Find $a$ when $b = 20$.

- First, find the constant of proportionality:
  - $a = \frac{k}{b}$
  - Substitute $b = 8$ and $a = 5$:
    - $5 = \frac{k}{8}$
  - Rearranging to find $k$:
    - $k = 5 \times 8 = 40$
- Now, use $k$ to find $a$ when $b = 20$:
  - $a = \frac{k}{b}$
  - Substitute $k = 40$ and $b = 20$:
    - $a = \frac{40}{20}$
  - Calculating $a$:
    - $a = 2$
- **Answer:** $a = 2$
