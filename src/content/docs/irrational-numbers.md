title: Irrational numbers
---

The opposite of a *rational number* is an *irrational number*. All *real*
numbers which are *not* rational are irrational.

By definition, all irrational numbers are also **real** numbers.

An irrational number is a real number which **can't** be written as a simple
fraction of two integers.

## Notation

The set of irrational numbers is usually represented by the symbol $\mathbb{I}$:

$$
\mathbb{I} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \notin \mathbb{Q} \}
$$

## Examples of irrational numbers

- $\sqrt{2}$ (cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers)
- $\pi$ (cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers)
- $e$ (cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers)
- $\frac{7\pi}{4}$ (cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers)

## Non-examples of irrational numbers

- $\frac{1}{2}$ (rational)
- $-3$ (rational)
- $0$ (rational)
- $4.75$ (rational)
- $7.66666\ldots$ (rational)
- $\sqrt{9}$ (rational, can be simplified to $3$)
- $\frac{4\pi}{2\pi}$ (rational, can be simplified to $2$)
- $i$ (not a *real* number)

## Decimal representation

The decimal equivalent to an irrational numbers have *non-terminating* and
*non-repeating* decimal.

This means that the digits after the decimal point go on forever without
ending, and there is no repeating pattern in the digits (e.g. how $\pi$ is
'completely random').
