A *sector* is a part of a circle with:
- two of its edges being the circle's [radius](/radius)
- its other edge being an [arc](/arc) of the circle.

Every circle with a sector will have **two sectors**:

## Minor sector

The *smallest* sector of a circle, and it contains the *minor [arc](/arc)*.

It has an angle of *less than* $\pi$ radians (less than half the circle).

## Major sector

The *largest* sector of a circle, and it contains the *major [arc](/arc)*.

It has an angle of *more than* $\pi$ radians (more than half the circle).
