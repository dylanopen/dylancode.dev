title: Logarithm of 1
---

For any base `b` (as long as `b` is greater than $0$ and not equal to $1$),
the logarithm of `1` is always `0`.

That's because any number raised to the power of `0` equals `1`.

We can write this as:

$$
\log_b(1) = 0 \quad \text{for any } b > 0 \text{ and } b \neq 1
$$

### Evaluate $\log_2(1)$

- $\log_2(1) = 0$ because $2^0 = 1$
- Answer: $0$

### Evaluate $\log_{10}(1)$

- $\log_{10}(1) = 0$ because $10^0 = 1$
- Answer: $0$

### Evaluate $\log_e(1)$

- $\log_e(1) = 0$ because $e^0 = 1$
- Answer: $0$

### Evaluate $\log_{0.5}(1)$

- $\log_{0.5}(1) = 0$ because $(0.5)^0 = 1$
- Answer: $0$

### Evaluate $\log_{-4}(1)$

- $\log_{-4}(1)$ is undefined because we can't find the logarithm of a
  negative base.
- Answer: undefined

### Find the value of $x$ such that $\log_3(x) = 0$

- $\log_3(x) = 0$ because $3^0 = 1$
- $x = 3^0 = 1$
- Answer: $1$

## Natural logarithms of $1$

Because we can rewrite $\ln(1)$ as $\log_e(1)$, we can evaluate it using the
same principle.

We know that $\log_e(1) = 0$ because $e^0 = 1$.

So $\ln(1) = 0$.

### Solve for $x$: $\ln(x) = 0$

- $\ln(x) = \log_e(x) = 0$ because $e^0 = 1$
- $x = e^0 = 1$
- Answer: $1$
