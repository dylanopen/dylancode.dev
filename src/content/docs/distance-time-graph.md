title: Distance-time graph
---

- A *distance-time graph* is a graph which shows:
  - the [distance](/distance) travelled by an object on the y-axis
  - the [time](/time) on the x-axis.
- They tell us how far an object has travelled over a period of time.

## Finding the distance

- If we want to find the distance travelled at a specific time, we can read it
  off the graph:
  - Find the time on the x-axis.
  - Move vertically up to the line on the graph.
  - Move horizontally to the y-axis to read off the distance.

### Find the distance travelled by the object at 4 seconds

Read off the graph at 4 seconds:

At 4 seconds, the distance is 12 m.

**Answer**: $12m$.

## Finding the speed / velocity

To find the speed (or velocity) of an object from a distance-time graph, we need
to find the gradient at that point.

If the distance-time graph is a straight line, the speed is constant, and we can
find the gradient of the line using $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ - the change
in $y$ divided by the change in $x$.

If it's not a straight line, we can draw a *tangent* to the curve at the point
we want to find the speed, and then find the gradient of that tangent line.

## Finding the average speed

To find the *average* speed over a period of time, we can use the formula:

$$
\text{average speed} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{\text{total time}}
$$

For example, to find the average speed between 2 seconds and 6 seconds:
- Assume the distance at 2 seconds is 8 m, and at 6 seconds is 20 m.
- Total distance = $20m - 8m = 12m$
- Total time = $6s - 2s = 4s$
- Average speed = $\frac{12m}{4s} = 3m/s$
