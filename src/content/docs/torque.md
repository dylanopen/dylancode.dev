title: Torque
---

A *torque* is when we have a *couple* acting on an object, to rotate it.

It basically measures the *magnitude* of the turning effect (moment) caused by
a couple.

Because it's a rotation, it must have a [moment](/moment)!

## Calculating torque

The turning effect is the *sum* of both moments in the couple.

- For example, if we have a couple with two forces:
  - A $5N$ force $2m$ away from the pivot, clockwise
  - A $5N$ force $3m$ away from the pivot, clockwise
- ...then we know that the first moment must be $5\times2=10Nm$ and the second
  moment must be $5\times3=15Nm$.
- Adding them together, we get $10Nm+15Nm=25Nm$, so our *torque* is 25Nm.

We could also have done this by simply multiplying the force by the distance
between the couple's forces:
- $2m+3m=5m$
- $M=5N\times5m=25Nm$
- That gives us the same torque of $25Nm$.

## Torque formula

We can use that to write a formula for torque, which looks very familiar:

$$
\text{torque}=Fd
$$

Where:
- $\text{torque}$ is the combined **moment** of the forces
- $F$ is the magnitude of *a single force* (one of the components of the couple)
- $d$ is the distance *between* the couple's forces

## Units of torque

Torque is just the combined [moment](/moment), so it's measured in the same way:
using newton-metres.

## Calculations

### Two forces of $8N$ act clockwise on a metal bar. The forces are $9m$ away from each other. Find the turning effect.

- $M=Fd$
- $M=8N\times9m$
- $M=72Nm$

### The torque on a stick is 7Nm. The perpendicular distance between the couple is 3.5m. Find the *sum* of the magnitudes of the forces acting.

- $M=Fd$
- $F=\frac Md$
- $F=\frac7{3.5}$
- $F=2N$
- The force of one is 2N
- So the combined force of *both* components of the couple must be $2\times2=4N$
- **Answer**: $4N$
