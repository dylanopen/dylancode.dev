title: NOR gate
---

A *NOR gate* is a combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.

In other words, it's an inverted OR gate.

It will output a `1` only when **both** of its input signals are `0`. In all
other cases, it will output a `0`.

## Truth table

| Input A | Input B | Output (A NOR B) |
|---------|---------|------------------|
|    0    |    0    |      **1**       |
|    0    |    1    |      **0**       |
|    1    |    0    |      **0**       |
|    1    |    1    |      **0**       |

> `1` if the inputs are *both* `0`.
