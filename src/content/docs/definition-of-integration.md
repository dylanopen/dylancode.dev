title: Definition of integration
---

**Integration** is the **opposite** of [differentiation](/definition-of-differentiation).

Instead of finding the gradient function - $f'(x)$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$ - from
the normal function, we instead find the normal function, given the gradient
function.

## Integral notation

We can write the integral of a function $y$ like this:

$$
\int y\space dx
$$

For example, for the function $2x^2-4x+1$:

$$
\int 2x^2-4x+1\space dx
$$

This means "the integral of $y$ with respect to $x$".
