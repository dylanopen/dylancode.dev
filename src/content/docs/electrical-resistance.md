title: Electrical resistance
---

- Resistance is the **opposition to the flow of current**.
- The symbol for resistance is $R$.
- The unit of resistance is the **ohm** ($\Omega$).
- A larger resistance means a smaller current for a given potential difference.
- It also transfers electrical energy into other forms (usually heat).

### Resistance equation

$$
\text{resistance} = \frac{\text{voltage}}{\text{current}}
$$

$$
R=\frac{V}{I}
$$
