title: Scalar quantity
---

A *scalar quantity* is a measurement which has a **magnitude only**.

> Magnitude is the *size* of the quantity - usually the number.

## Examples of scalar quantities

- Length
- Distance
- Speed
- Temperature
- Charge
- Voltages (e.g. potential difference)
- Energy

## Adding scalars

To add two scalars together, we just... add the scalars together.

For example:
- $2m+3m=5m$
- $4V+2V=2V$

## Subtracting scalars

It works the same way as adding them:

- $5J-2J=3J$
- $8\degree C - 3\degree C = 5 \degree C$
