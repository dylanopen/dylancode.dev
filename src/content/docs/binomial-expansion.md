title: Binomial expansion
---

*Binomial expansion* is a way of expanding an expression in the form $(a+b)^n$
into a sum of terms, e.g. $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.

Instead of us having to multiply out large sets of brackets, we can just use
a few formulas or buttons on the calculator to find the expansion.
