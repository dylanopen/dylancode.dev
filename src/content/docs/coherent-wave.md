title: Coherent wave
---

If two waves are *coherent*, it means that they have a constant phase difference
between them. This means that the peaks and troughs of the waves line up with
each other in a consistent way.

They need to have:
- Same wavelengths
- Similar amplitudes
- The same *plane of [polarisation](/polarisation)*

## Coherennce in diffraction

We need the waves used in diffraction to be *coherent*, because otherwise an
integer [path difference](/path-difference) multiple of the wavelength would not
always interfere constructively.

We can put a *single slit* in front of the two slits to make sure that the waves
going into the two slits are coherent - the single slit creates a single wave
that then splits into two waves when it passes through the double slit.

> We only need to do that if the light source is not already coherent (for
> example, if it's a laser, we don't need to do that, because the light from a
> laser is already coherent).
