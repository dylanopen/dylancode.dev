title: Collecting like terms
---

*Collecting like terms* involves taking a more complex expression, where
multiple terms are added or subtracted from each other, and simplifying it by
combining terms that are similar.

## What are like terms?

Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.

For example, in the expression $3x + 5x - 2y + 4y$, the terms $3x$ and $5x$ are
like terms because they both contain the variable $x$.

Similarly, $-2y$ and $4y$ are like like terms because they both contain the
variable $y$.

However, $3x$ and $-2y$ are not like terms because they contain different
variables. $x$ and $x^2$ are also not like terms because the powers are
different.

## Addition of algebraic terms

To combine like terms, we need to know a fundamental rule:

$$
ax + bx = (a + b)x
$$

This basically means that, when we add two terms with the same variable, we can
add their coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) together and keep
the variable part the same.

## Examples

### Simplify $4x + 3x - 2y + 5y$

- Find the like terms:
  - $4x$ and $3x$ are like terms.
  - $-2y$ and $5y$ are like terms.
- Combine the like terms:
  - $4x + 3x = (4 + 3)x = 7x$
  - $-2y + 5y = (-2 + 5)y = 3y$
- Write the simplified expression:
  - $7x + 3y$
- **Answer:** $7x + 3y$

### Simplify $6a - 4a + 2b + 3b - b$

- Find the like terms:
  - $6a$ and $-4a$ are like terms.
  - $2b$, $3b$, and $-b$ are like terms.
- Combine the like terms:
  - $6a - 4a = (6 - 4)a = 2a$
  - $2b + 3b - b = (2 + 3 - 1)b = 4b$
- Write the simplified expression:
  - $2a + 4b$
- **Answer:** $2a + 4b$

### Simplify $5m + 2n - 3m + 4 - n + 7 - 4n^2$

- Find the like terms:
  - $5m$ and $-3m$ are like terms.
  - $2n$ and $-n$ are like terms.
  - $4$ and $7$ are like terms (constants).
  - $-4n^2$ has no like terms.
- Combine the like terms:
  - $5m - 3m = (5 - 3)m = 2m$
  - $2n - n = (2 - 1)n = 1n = n$
  - $4 + 7 = 11$
- Write the simplified expression:
  - $2m + n + 11 - 4n^2$
- **Answer:** $2m + n + 11 - 4n^2$
