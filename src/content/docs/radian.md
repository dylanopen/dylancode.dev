A *radian* is a way we can measure angles - just like degrees!

The radian has a few useful properties though.

## Radians in a full circle

There are $2\pi$ radians in a full turn of a circle.

## Converting from/to degrees

- $2\pi rad=360\degree$
- so: $1\pi rad=180\degree$

To convert degrees to radians:
- Multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$

To convert radians to degrees:
- Multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$
