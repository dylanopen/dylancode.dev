title: Free fall
---

When an object is in *free fall*, it is only under the influence of gravity.

That means it has no air resistance, and no other forces are acting on it.

All objects in free fall accelerate at the same rate, even if their masses are
different.

The acceleration due to gravity depends on which gravitational field the object
is in. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is about $9.81ms^{-2}$.

That's why, if you drop a feather and a hammer in a vacuum, such as on the Moon,
they will fall at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time!

The rate at which objects accelerate in free fall can be called one of two
things:
- the **acceleration due to gravity** - measured in $ms^{-2}$
- the **gravitational field strength** - measured in $Nkg^{-1}$

## Equations

$$
\text{acceleration due to gravity} = \frac{2 \times \text{distance fallen}}{\text{time taken}^2}
$$

$$
g = \frac{2h}{t^2}
$$

Where:
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (or gravitational field strength) in $ms^{-2}$ or $Nkg^{-1}$
- $h$ is the distance fallen in meters ($m$)
- $t$ is the time taken in seconds ($s$)
