title: Converting bytes to bits
---

If we have a number of bytes and want to convert it to bits, we can *multiply*
the number of bits by 8, since there are 8 bits in a byte:

$$
\text{bits} = \text{bytes} \times 8
$$

## Examples

### Convert $8$ bytes to bits

- $8 \times 8 = 64$ bits
- **Answer**: $64$ bits

### Convert $128$ bytes to bits

- $128 \times 8 = 1024$ bits
- **Answer**: $1024$ bits

### Convert $625$ bytes to bits

- $625 \times 8 = 5000$ bits
- **Answer**: $5000$ bits

### Convert $1543.125$ bytes to bits

- $1543.125 \times 8 = 12345$ bits
- **Answer**: $12345$ bits
