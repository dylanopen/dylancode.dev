## Factorising where $a=1$

It is possible to *factorise* a quadratic expression, such as $x^2+3x+2$, into
a *factorised form**, such as $(x+2)(x+1)$.

For a simple quadratic where $a$ (the coefficient of $x^2$) is $1$, we find two
numbers which multiply to give $2$, and add to give $3$. In this case: $2$ and
$1$.

### Example: factorise $x^2+5x+6$

- We need two numbers which multiply to give $6$, and add to give $5$.
- The numbers $2$ and $3$ work, since $2\times3=6$ and $2+3=5$.
- Therefore, we can factorise $x^2+5x+6$ as $(x+2)(x+3)$.

## Factorising where $a\ne1$

When $a$ is not equal to $1$, we can use a method called *splitting the
middle term* (or simply called 'the split method').

First, we multiply $a$ and $c$ together. Then, we find two numbers which
multiply to give $ac$, and add to give $b$. We then split the middle term
using these two numbers, and factor by grouping.

### Example: factorise $2x^2+7x+3$

- $a=2$, $b=7$ and $c=3$.
- $ac=2\times3=6$.
- We need two numbers which multiply to give $6$, and add to give $7$
- The numbers $6$ and $1$ work, since $6\times1=6$ and $6+1=7$.
- Split the middle term into $6x$ and $1x$:
  - $2x^2+6x+1x+3$
- Use the distributive law to factor by grouping:
  - $2x(x+3)+1(x+3)$
- Factor out the common factor $(x+3)$:
  - $(x+3)(2x+1)$
- Answer: $(x+3)(2x+1)$.

### Example: factorise $3x^2-11x+10$

- $a=3$, $b=-11$ and $c=10$.
- $ac=3\times10=30$.
- We need two numbers which multiply to give $30$, and add to give $-11
- The numbers $-5$ and $-6$ work, since $-5\times-6=30$ and $-5+(-6)=-11$.
- Split the middle term into $-5x$ and $-6x$:
  - $3x^2-5x-6x+10$
- Use the distributive law to factor by grouping:
  - $x(3x-5)-2(3x-5)$
- Factor out the common factor $(3x-5)$:
  - $(3x-5)(x-2)$
- Answer: $(3x-5)(x-2)$.
