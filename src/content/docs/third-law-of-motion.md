title: Third law of motion
---

Newton's *third* law of motion states that:

> Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.

It's worded more like this:

> At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.

## In simple terms

If object A puts a force to object B, object B will put a force 

For example:
- If you push against a wall, the wall pushes back against you with the same amount of force, but in the opposite direction.
- If you jump off a boat, you push the boat backwards with the same amount of force as the boat pushes you forwards.
- If you hit a ball with a bat, the ball exerts an equal and opposite force on the bat.

## What Newton's third law *isn't*

- Suppose we have a book on a table.
- You might think that the *normal contact force* from the table on the book is the 'equal and opposite' force to the *weight* of the book (the force of gravity pulling it down).
- But these two forces aren't actually an action-reaction pair, because they act on the same object (the book).
