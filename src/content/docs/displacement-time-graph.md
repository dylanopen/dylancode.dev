title: Displacement-time graph
---

- A *displacement-time graph* is a graph which shows:
  - the [displacement](/displacement) travelled by an object on the y-axis
  - the [time](/time) on the x-axis.
- They tell us how far away from its starting position an object has travelled
  over a period of time.

## Finding the displacement

- If we want to find the displacmenet from the starting point at a specific
  time, we can read it off the graph:
  - Find the time on the x-axis.
  - Move vertically up to the line on the graph.
  - Move horizontally to the y-axis to read off the displacement.

### Find the displacement of the object at 4 seconds

```

Read off the graph at 4 seconds:

At 4 seconds, the displacement is 12 m.

**Answer**: $12m$.

## Finding the velocity

To find the velocity of an object from a displacement-time graph, we need
to find the gradient at that point.

If the displacement-time graph is a straight line, the velocity is constant, and we can
find the gradient of the line using $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ - the change
in $y$ divided by the change in $x$.

If it's not a straight line, we can draw a *tangent* to the curve at the point
we want to find the velocity, and then find the gradient of that tangent line.

## Finding the average velocity

To find the *average* velocity over a period of time, we can use the formula:

$$
\text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{total displacement}}{\text{total time}}
$$

For example, to find the average velocity between 2 seconds and 6 seconds:
- Assume the displacement at 2 seconds is 8 m, and at 6 seconds is 20 m.
- Total displacement = $20m - 8m = 12m$
- Total time = $6s - 2s = 4s$
- Average velocity = $\frac{12m}{4s} = 3m/s$
