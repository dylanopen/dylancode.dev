title: Longitudinal wave
---

A *longitudinal wave* is a type of wave where the particle displacement (the
way they vibrate) is parallel to the direction of energy propagation.

More simply, the particles in the medium move back and forth in the same
direction that the wave is travelling.

## Compression and rarefaction

In a longitudinal wave, there are regions where the particles are:
- compressed together - known as *compressions*
- spread apart - known as *rarefactions*

When a longitudinal wave travels through a medium, it creates alternating
compressions and rarefactions.

For example, sound waves in air are longitudinal waves. As the sound wave
travels, it causes air particles to compress and then spread apart, creating
variations in pressure that we hear as sound!

## Examples of longitudinal waves

- Sound waves in air
- P-waves (primary waves) in earthquakes
- Ultrasound waves used in medical imaging
