title: Diffraction of waves
---

Diffraction is when waves *spread out* as they pass through a gap or around an
obstacle. The amount of diffraction depends on the *size of the gap* compared to
the *wavelength* of the waves.

## Diffraction through a gap



When waves pass through a gap, they spread out on the other side. The amount of
spreading depends on the size of the gap relative to the wavelength of the waves:
- If the gap is *much larger* than the wavelength, the waves spread out only a
  little.
- If the gap is *about the same size* as the wavelength, the waves spread out
  quite a lot.
- If the gap is *much smaller* than the wavelength, the waves spread out a lot.
