An integer is a *whole number*.

By definition, it is both **rational** and **real**.

It can be positive, negative or zero - the only constraint is that it cannot
have a fractional part (e.g. it can't be a decimal or fraction).

## Notation

The set of integers is usually denoted by the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$:

$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}
$$

## Examples of integers

- $-10$
- $0$
- $42$
- $7$
- $-256$

## Non-examples of integers

- $3.14$ (has a fractional part - the decimal .14)
- $-2.5$ (has a fractional part - the decimal .5)
- $\frac{1}{2}$ (has a fractional part)
- $\sqrt{2}$ (irrational so not whole)
- $\pi$ (irrational so not whole)
- $i$ (not a *real* number)
