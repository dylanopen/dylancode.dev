title: Protons
---

## Location

- Protons are found in the [nucleus](/nucleus) of an atom.
- They're found alongside the [neutrons](/neutrons).

## Charge

- Protons have a positive charge.
- Their charge *relative* to other subatomic particles is $1+$.

## Mass

- The *atomic mass* of a proton is 1.
- This is (almost) the same as the mass of a neutron, which is also 1.
- It is much larger than an [electron](/electrons).

## Electrons in an atom

- [Atoms](/atoms) have equal numbers of protons and electrons
  - That's because atoms, unlike [ions](/ions), are *neutral* overall.
