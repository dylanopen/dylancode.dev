title: Couple
---

A *couple* is a set of two forces that have:
- the **same** magnitude
- **opposite** directions

For example, there may be one force which acts upwards at $9N$, and another
force that acts downwards at $9N$ on another part of the object.

## Points of action

Importantly, when we have a couple, the forces *do not* act on the same point.

Usually, they'll act on opposite sides of a pivot, which creates a turning
effect.

## Transformation from a couple

- Because the forces are equal and act in opposite directions, they **do not**
  translate (move) the object.
- They *do* rotate the object. You can see how that works here:

```
    |        d
 6N |     <----->
    ⌄     
----------+----------
                ^
    <----->     | 6N
       d        |
```

- Both forces are the same distance from the pivot in this example.
- They have the same force, which means that the object isn't going to go up or
  down.
- But the forces are in opposite directions: both are going **anticlockwise**
  around the pivot (`+`). That means that the plank will turn *anticlockwise*.
