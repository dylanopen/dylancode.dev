## Types of voltage

There are two types of energy transfers in 
- When energy is 'lost' by a coulomb (i.e. 'given' to a component), it's called
  'potential difference'.
- When energy is 'gained' by a coulomb (usually from a cell), it's called 
  'EMF'.

## Potential difference

- Potential difference is the **work done by unit charge**.
- It's a type of voltage that represents the energy transferred to or from
  a component in a circuit (not from the cell/battery).
- If the potential difference across a component is, for example, $6V$, that
  menas that $1C$ of charge transfers $6J$ of energy to the component.
- It's called the 'potential difference' because it is the difference in energy
  (work done) or volts across a component.
- Potential difference can be measured with a **voltmeter**.

### Potential difference equation - work done and charge

$$
\text{potential difference} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{charge}}
$$

$$
V=\frac WQ
$$

### Potential difference equation - current and resistance

$$
\text{potential difference} = \text{current} \times \text{resistance}
$$

$$
V=IR
$$
