title: Second law of motion
---

Newton's *second* law of motion states:

> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting
> on it, and inversely proportional to its mass.

## What does this mean?

- If you apply a greater force to an object, it will accelerate more.
- If you apply the same force to a heavier object, it will accelerate less:
  - That's because heavier objects need more force to accelerate them (because
    they have more [inertia](/inertia)).

## Equations

In short, Newton's second law of motion can be written as:

$$
F = ma
$$

Where:
- $F$ is the net force acting on the object in newtons ($N$)
- $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms ($kg$)
- $a$ is the acceleration of the object in meters per second squared ($ms^{-2}$)
