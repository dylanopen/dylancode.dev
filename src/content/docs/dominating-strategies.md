title: Dominating strategies
---

A dominating strategy is an option that a player can choose that **always**
results in a better outcome for that player, regardless of what the other
players do.

For example, consider the following payoff matrix for a two-player zero-sum game:

|               | Player B: Choice C | Player B: Choice D|
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Player A: Choice A** | 3             | 1              |
| **Player A: Choice B** | 4             | 2              |

- If Player A chooses **Choice A**, they get 3 points if Player B chooses **Choice C** and 2 points if Player B chooses **Choice D**.
- If Player A chooses **Choice B**, they get 4 points if Player B chooses **Choice C** and 1 point if Player B chooses **Choice D**.

In this case, **Choice B** is a dominating strategy for Player A because it
results in a better outcome (4 points vs. 3 points and 1 point vs. 2 points)
regardless of what Player B chooses.
