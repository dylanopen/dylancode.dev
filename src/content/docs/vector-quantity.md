title: Vector quantity
---

Unlike a [scalar quantity](/scalar-quantity), a *vector quantity* is a
measurement which has both a **magnitude** and a **direction**.

For example, we'd consider *velocity* to be a vector, because it has a *speed*
(magnitude) and a *direction* (e.g. north, south, east, west, up, down etc).

> If a value can have a positive or negative value, then it's likely to be a
> vector quantity - because the sign can indicate the direction.

## Examples of vector quantities

- Displacement
- Velocity
- Acceleration
- Force
- Momentum
- Field strength
- Current (can be positive or negative)
