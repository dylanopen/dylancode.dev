title: Wave path difference
---

If we have two waves that are *in phase* at a certain point, the *path
difference* is the difference in the distance that the two waves have traveled
to reach that point.

We measure it in terms of the wavelength ($\lambda$) of the waves.

## Constructive interference

If the path difference is a multiple of the wavelength (for example, $\lambda$,
$2\lambda$, $3\lambda$), the waves will interfere constructively, and create a
wave with a larger amplitude.

## Destructive interference

If the path difference is a half multiple of the wavelength (for example, $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$, $\frac{3}{2}\lambda$, $\frac{5}{2}\lambda$), the waves will
interfere destructively, and create a wave with a smaller amplitude (or even
zero if the waves had the same amplitude to start with).
