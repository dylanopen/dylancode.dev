title: Work done and power
---

We can link the concept of [work done](/work-done) to [power](/power)!

Power usually refers to energy, as we'll revisit in a minute, but since work
done just means energy transferred, we can also link power to work done.

## Power and energy

The normal formula for power is:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy transferred}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

Or, in symbols:

$$
P = \frac{E}{t}
$$

Where:
- $P$ is the power, in watts, $W$
- $E$ is the energy transferred, in joules, $J$
- $t$ is the time taken, in seconds, $s$

## Power and work done

Using the knowledge that [work done](/work-done) is just the same thing as
energy transferred, we can write this as:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

Or in symbols:

> $$
> P = \frac{W}{t}
> $$

Where:
- $P$ is the power, in watts, $W$
- $W$ is the work done, in joules, $J$
- $t$ is the time taken, in seconds, $s$

### A machine does 500 J of work in 10 s. What is the power of the machine?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $W = 500\,J$
- $t = 10\,s$
- $P = \frac{500\,J}{10\,s}$
- $P = 50\,W$   

### A machine does 1000 J of work in 20 s. What is the power of the machine?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $W = 1000\,J$
- $t = 20\,s$
- $P = \frac{1000\,J}{20\,s}$
- $P = 50\,W$

### A machine has a power of 200 W and does 400 J of work. How long does it take to do the work?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $P = 200\,W$
- $W = 400\,J$
- $t = \frac{W}{P}$
- $t = \frac{400\,J}{200\,W}$
- $t = 2\,s$

### A machine has a power of 150 W and does 300 J of work. How long does it take to do the work?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $P = 150\,W$
- $W = 300\,J$
- $t = \frac{W}{P}$
- $t = \frac{300\,J}{150\,W}$
- $t = 2\,s$

### A mechanical device does 50 W of power over a period of 5 s. How much work does it do?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $P = 50\,W$
- $t = 5\,s$
- $W = Pt$
- $W = 50\,W \times 5\,s$
- $W = 250\,J$

### A mechanical device does 75 W of power over a period of 8 s. How much work does it do?

- $P = \frac{W}{t}$
- $P = 75\,W$
- $t = 8\,s$
- $W = Pt$
- $W = 75\,W \times 8\,s$
- $W = 600\,J$
