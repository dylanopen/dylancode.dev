title: Local area network
---

A *LAN* is a network of devices that are connected over a **small geographical
area**.

Generally, they connect the devices in a single building to each other, but
*are not* connected to other devices outside the region (such as the Internet).

They're essentially a little mini network which can only be accessed from a
certain area and organisation. So they are useful for connecting devices locally
\- but they don't connect to anything outside of the LAN **unless** you connect
them to a WAN using a router - which may, for example, connect to the Internet,
which is the world's largest [Wide Area Network](/wide-area-network).

## Central server

Because a LAN is a small network, it can usually be managed by a single central
[server](/server). That's a computer that manages the network and all the
devices on it.

It can do things like:
- Store files and data for the devices on the network to access
- Manage user accounts and permissions for the devices on the network
- Provide security and other protections for the devices on the network
- make sure the computers are up to date with the latest version of software
  (which is important for security and performance) 
- Keep backups of important data, so that if something goes wrong, the data can
  be restored easily from one central location.
