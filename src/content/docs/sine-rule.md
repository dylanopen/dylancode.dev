title: Sine rule
---

The sine rule can be used to find an angle or side if we know:
- a side lenght
- the size of the angle opposite that side
- any other side or angle

## The triangle

The lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$ represent the side lengths in this triangle.  
The angles $A$, $B$ and $C$ represent the angles in the triangle.

```
            A
          /   \
     c  /       \  b
      /           \
    /               \
   B ---------------- C
            a
```

## The sine rule formula

Using the triangle above, the sine rule tells us that:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

and, equivalently:

$$
\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}
$$

> This means that the ratio of a side length to the sine of its opposite
> angle is the same for all three sides and angles in the triangle.
