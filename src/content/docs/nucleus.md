title: Nucleus
---

- The *nucleus* is the small, dense region at the center of an atom.
- It contains most of the atom's mass but very little of its volume.

## Radius

The radius of the nuclei is *very* small compared to the total size of the
atom. It's usually around 1/10,000th of the radius of the entire atom.

## Charge

- The nucleus is made up of *protons* (positively charged particles) and
  *neutrons* (neutral particles).
  - Because of this, the overall charge of the nucleus is positive.
