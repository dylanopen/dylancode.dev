This is due to the **conservation of charge** - charge cannot be created or
destroyed.

We can write this as:

$$
\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}
$$

### Example

At a junction, three currents meet. Two of the currents are entering the junction
with values of $3A$ and $5A$. The third current is leaving the junction. What
is the value of the third current?

- Sum of currents entering the junction: $3A + 5A = 8A$
- So the current leaving the junction must also be $8A$ due to Kirchoff's first
  law.

## Sum of all currents

Kirchoff's first law can also be expressed as:

$$
\sum I_{in} - \sum I_{out} = 0
$$
