title: Momentum
---

*Momentum* is a measure of how difficult it is to stop an object.

It takes into account both the:
- mass of the object (how much matter it contains)
- velocity of the object (how fast it's moving)

In a way, it's similar to inertia, though inertia only takes into account the
mass of the object, not also the velocity.

## Units

Momentum is measured in kilogram meters per second ($kgms^{-1}$).

## Calculating momentum

We know because of the units, we can calculate momentum using the following
equation:

$$
\text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}
$$

$$
p = mv
$$

Where:
- $p$ is the momentum in kilogram meters per second ($kgms^{-1}$)
- $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms ($kg$)
- $v$ is the velocity of the object in meters per second ($ms^{-1}$)

## Stopping an object

The greater the momentum of an object, the more difficult it is to stop it.
