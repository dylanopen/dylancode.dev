title: Planar graph
---
A *planar graph* is a type of [graph](/graph) that can be drawn on a flat
surface (like a piece of paper) without any of its [edges](/graph-edge)
crossing each other (except at the [vertices](/graph-vertex), I suppose).

> **Planar graph**: a graph which can be drawn so that no edges cross.

## Euler's formula

For any connected planar graph, there is a relationship between the number of
vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) of the graph:

$$
V - E + F = 2
$$

Where:
- $V$ = number of vertices
- $E$ = number of edges
- $F$ = number of faces (including the outer, infinite face)

This is Euler's formula for planar graphs.
