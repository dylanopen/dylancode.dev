title: Compound uncertainty

## Uncertainty of a single measurement

If we know the *resolution* of a measuring apparatus (e.g. how far apart the
lines are on a ruler), we can find the uncertainty using:

$$
\text{uncertainty}=\pm\space\frac{\text{smallest division on the scale}}2
$$

## Uncertainty of repeat measurements

To find the uncertainty of a *repeat* measurement (i.e. multiple tries), you
find the **mean**, and then use the method above to find the uncertainty of a
single measurement.

$$
\text{uncertainty}=\pm\space\frac{\text{smallest division on the scale}}2\times2
$$

...which simplifies to:

$$
\text{uncertainty}=\pm\space\text{smallest division on the scale}
$$

## Uncertainty of double-sided apparatus

If we have some apparatus where we need to measure something in two places (e.g.
measuring ona ruler the start and end point) we **double the uncertainty**.

## Overall percentage uncertainty

If we have a compound measurement which we find using a *formula* of different
measurements (which each have their own uncertainty), we simply **add** the
individual percentage uncertainties together.
