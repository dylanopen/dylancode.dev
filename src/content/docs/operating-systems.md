## Purpose of an operating system

- The purpose of an operating system is to provide an interface between the user
  and the hardware.
- This means that we can use the computer and write programs for it, without
  needing to understand the inner-workings of the hardware.

## What does the operating system manage?

- Memory
- Processes
- Hardware devices
- File systems
- Security
- A user interface (though this may be a separate utility program)

## Examples of operating systems

- Linux
- FreeBSD
- macOS
- Windows
