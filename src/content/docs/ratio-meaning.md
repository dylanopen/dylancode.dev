title: Ratio meaning
---

- A *ratio* is a way of comparing two or more quantities.
- It tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another thing.
- For example, we could have a ratio which tells us how many apples there are
  compared to how many oranges there are.
- Importantly, they **don't** tell us the actual amounts of each thing, just how
  their amounts compare to each other.

## Writing ratios

- If we know that we have $n$ apples and $m$ oranges, we can write the ratio of
  apples to oranges as $n:m$.
- For example, if we have 3 apples and 5 oranges, we can write the ratio of
  apples to oranges as $3:5$.
- This could also be written in any *equivalent* form. For example, the $3:5$
  apples to oranges ratio could also be written as $6:10$ or $9:15$, for
  example.
- To find equivalent ratios, we can multiply or divide both sides of the ratio
  by the same number - see [simplifying ratios](/simplifying-ratios) for more
  details.

## Examples

### A fruit bowl contains pears and bananas in the ratio 2:3. If there are 8 pears, how many bananas are there?

- The ratio of pears to bananas is $2:3$.
- We can see that each *part* pear is equal to $4$ actual pears, because:
  - $8 \div 2 = 4$
- To keep the ratio the same, we need to multiply the number of bananas by $4$ as well:
- $3 \times 4 = 12$
- **Answer**: there are $12$ bananas.

### A classroom has boys and girls in the ratio 5:4. If there are 20 boys, how many girls are there?

- The ratio of boys to girls is $5:4$.
- We can see that each *part* boy is equal to $4$ actual boys, because:
  - $20 \div 5 = 4$
- To keep the ratio the same, we need to multiply the number of part girls by
  $4$ as well:
  - $4 \times 4 = 16$
- **Answer**: there are $16$ girls.
