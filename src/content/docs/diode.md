title: Diode
---

- A diode only allows current to flow in one direction.
- It has very high resistance in the reverse direction.

## I-V characteristic of a diode

In the forward direction:
- The current is incredibly small until it reaches its *activation voltage*.
- That's usually about 0.7 V for a silicon diode.
- After that, the current increases mostly proportionally with voltage.
In the reverse direction:
- The current is almost zero, regardless of the voltage.
- This means the resistance is extremely high in the reverse direction.

## Uses of diodes

- Diodes can be used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).
- This is done in a component called a *rectifier*.
- The diode only allows the positive half-cycles of the AC to pass through.
- The negative half-cycles are blocked, resulting in a pulsating DC output.
