title: Energy forms
---

Energy can be in different 'forms' depending on what it is doing:

- [Kinetic energy](/kinetic-energy) is the energy which makes objects move or
  vibrate.
- [Gravitational potential energy](/gravitational-potential-energy) is the
  energy which makes objects fall to the ground.
- [Elastic potential energy](/elastic-potential-energy) is the energy which
  makes objects stretch and compress.
- [Chemical energy](/chemical-energy) is the energy which makes chemical
  reactions happen.
- [Thermal energy](/thermal-energy) is the energy which makes things hot. It's
  really just an 'intermediate step' before energy is transferred into *kinetic*
  energy of the particles in the object, which is what makes it hot.
- [Nuclear energy](/nuclear-energy) is the energy which makes nuclear reactions
  haappen. 
- [Electrical energy](/electrical-energy) is the energy which makes electric
  currents flow. Think: energy in wires of circuits.
- [Magnetic energy](/magnetic-energy) is the energy which makes magnets attract
  and repel each other.
- [Sound energy](/sound-energy) - although this is also kind of just kinetic
  energy. The thing you hear is the particles vibrating - so kinetic.
- [Mechanical energy](/mechanical-energy) is the energy which makes things move
  and do work.

Here's a summary of them all:
