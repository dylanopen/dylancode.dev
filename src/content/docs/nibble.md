A *nibble* is simply **4 [bits](/bit)**.

## Number of values represented by nibbles

> A nibble can represent 16 different values.

This is because a nibble is made up of 4 bits, and each bit can be in one of two
states (0 or 1). Therefore, the total number of combinations of 4 bits is

$$
2^4 = 16
$$
