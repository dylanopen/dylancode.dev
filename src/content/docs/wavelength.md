title: Wavelength
---

The *wavelength* of a wave is the distance between two consecutive points that
are in phase (for example, two consecutive peaks or troughs) in a wave.

## Notation

We typically represente wavelength using the Greek letter lambda: $\lambda$.

## Units

Wavelength is a, well, length, so we measure it in **metres** ($m$) - or another
derivation of it, such as centimetres.

## Calculating wavelength

Wavelength can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Wavelength} = \frac{\text{Speed of wave}}{\text{Frequency}}
$$

Or, using symbols:

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength (in metres, $m$)
- $v$ is the [speed of the wave](/wave-speed) (in metres per second, $m/s$)
- $f$ is the [frequency](/wave-frequency) of the wave (in hertz, $Hz$)
