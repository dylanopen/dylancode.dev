title: Dynamic libraries
---

- Dynamic libraries are files on a computer which have *shared code* which can
  be used by multiple different programs.
- This means that programs don't need to include all of the code they need to
  function within their own files, which saves space on the computer.
- Instead, they can just call the functions they need from the dynamic library.
- The operating system loads these libraries when programs need them.

### Examples of libraries

- `gcc-libs`
- `OpenSSL`
- `OpenGL`
- `Vulkan`
- `GLFW`
