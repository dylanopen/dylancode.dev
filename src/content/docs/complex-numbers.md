title: Complex numbers

A complex number is a number which contains both an *imaginary part* and a *real
part*.

## Form of a complex number

Complex numbers take this form:

$$
x+yi
$$

This can also rewritten as $x+iy$ and (rarely) $yi+x$ or $iy+x$.

## Real part

The real part of a complex number $x+yi$ is $x$.
It is the number without an $i$ term, and is the number we are used to using in
everyday maths.

## Imaginary part

The imaginary part of a complex number $x+yi$ is $y$.
It is the coefficient of $i$ (and the vertical coordinate on an Argand diagram).

## Equality of complex numbers

Two complex numbers are equal if both their real and imaginary parts are equal.
