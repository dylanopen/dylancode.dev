title: Kinetic energy
---

*Kinetic energy* is the energy which makes objects move or vibrate.

## Calculating kinetic energy

If we know the:
- mass of the object, in kilograms, $kg$
- speed of the object, in metres per second, $m/s$

...then we can calculate the amount of kinetic energy it has!

The formula we use is:

$$
\text{Kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{speed}^2
$$

If we put it into symbols, we get:

> $$
> E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
> $$

Where:
- $E_k$ is the kinetic energy, in joules, $J$
- $m$ is the mass of the object, in kilograms, $kg$
- $v$ is the speed of the object, in metres per second, $m/s$

## Examples

### A car has a mass of 1000 kg and is moving at a speed of 20 m/s. What is its kinetic energy?

- $m = 1000\,kg$
- $v = 20\,m/s$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2} \times 1000\,kg \times (20\,m/s)^2$
- $E_k = 200,000\,J$

### A cyclist has a kinetic energy of 1400 J and is moving at a speed of 7 m/s. What is the mass of the cyclist?

- $E_k = 1400\,J$
- $v = 7\,m/s$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $m = \frac{2E_k}{v^2}$
- $m = \frac{2 \times 1400\,J}{(7\,m/s)^2}$
- $m = 57.14\,kg$

### A ball has a kinetic energy of 50 J and a mass of 0.5 kg. What is the speed of the ball?

- $E_k = 50\,J$
- $m = 0.5\,kg$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}$
- $v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 50\,J}{0.5\,kg}}$
- $v = 14.14\,m/s$
