title: Solving linear equations
---

In order to solve *any* equation, we need to get the variable we are solving for
on one side of the equation and everything else on the other side.

To do this, we follow one simple rule:

> Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side.

With that rule in mind, we can just use logic to think 'what do I need to do in
order to get the variable on its own?'

## Example questions

### Solve for x: $2x + 3 = 7$

- Subtract $3$ from both sides:
  - $2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3$
  - $2x = 4$
- Divide both sides by $2$:
  - $\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2}$
  - $x = 2$
- **Answer**: $x = 2$

### Solve for y: $5y - 10 = 15$

- Add $10$ to both sides:
  - $5y - 10 + 10 = 15 + 10$
  - $5y = 25$
- Divide both sides by $5$:
  - $\frac{5y}{5} = \frac{25}{5}$
  - $y = 5$
- **Answer**: $y = 5$

### Solve for z: $3z + 4 = 2z + 9$

- Subtract $2z$ from both sides:
  - $3z - 2z + 4 = 2z - 2z + 9$
  - $z + 4 = 9$
- Subtract $4$ from both sides:
  - $z + 4 - 4 = 9 - 4$
  - $z = 5$
- **Answer**: $z = 5$

### Solve for a: $\frac{4a}2 + 6 = 10$

- Subtract $6$ from both sides:
  - $\frac{4a}2 + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6$
  - $\frac{4a}2 = 4$
- Multiply both sides by $2$:
  - $2 \times \frac{4a}2 = 4 \times 2$
  - $4a = 8$
- Divide both sides by $4$:
  - $\frac{4a}{4} = \frac{8}{4}$
  - $a = 2$
- **Answer**: $a = 2$

### Solve for b: $7 - 3b = 1 + 2b$

- Subtract $1$ from both sides:
  - $7 - 1 - 3b = 1 - 1 + 2b$
  - $6 - 3b = 2b$
- Add $3b$ to both sides:
  - $6 - 3b + 3b = 2b + 3b$
  - $6 = 5b$
- Divide both sides by $5$:
  - $\frac{6}{5} = \frac{5b}{5}$
  - $\frac{6}{5} = b$
- **Answer**: $b = \frac{6}{5}$

### Solve for c: $2(c - 3) + 4 = 10$

- Expand the left side:
  - $2c - 6 + 4 = 10$
  - $2c - 2 = 10$
- Add $2$ to both sides:
  - $2c - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2$
  - $2c = 12$
- Divide both sides by $2$:
  - $\frac{2c}{2} = \frac{12}{2}$
  - $c = 6$
- **Answer**: $c = 6$

### Solve for d: $\frac{d + 2}3 = 5$

- Multiply both sides by $3$:
  - $3 \times \frac{d + 2}3 = 5 \times 3$
  - $d + 2 = 15$
- Subtract $2$ from both sides:
  - $d + 2 - 2 = 15 - 2$
  - $d = 13$
- **Answer**: $d = 13$
