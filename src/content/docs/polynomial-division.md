title: Polynomial division
---

Polynomial division is where we take a *polynomial* (an expression made up of
only positive whole number powers of $x$) and divide it by another polynomial.

For example: $\frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x - 2}$.

## The grid method

Just like how we can use the grid method to multiply polynomials (also known as
'expanding brackets'), we can also use it to divide polynomials.

### Example: Divide $x^2 - 5x + 6$ by $x - 2$ using the grid method

- Add the thing we are dividing by ($x - 2$) to the left side of the grid.

| $\times$ |   |   |   |
|----------|---|---|---|
| $x$      |   |   |   |
| $-2$     |   |   |   |

We know that we must have an $x^2$ term in the top-left of the main grid area
(as there will only be one multiplication which makes a term with an $x^2$ in
it).  
We also know that we have a $6$ in the bottom-right of the main grid area (as
there will only be one multiplication which makes a term without an $x$ in it).

| $\times$ |       |     |     |
|----------|-------|-----|-----|
| $x$      | $x^2$ |     |     |
| $-2$     |       |     | $6$ |

Next, we can fill in the rest of the grid by looking at what terms we need to
make.
