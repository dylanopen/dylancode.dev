title: Converting bits to bytes
---

If we have a number of bits and want to convert it to bytes, we can *divide* the
number of bits by 8, since there are 8 bits in a byte:

$$
\text{bytes} = \text{bits} \div 8
$$

## Examples

### Convert $64$ bits to bytes

- $64 \div 8 = 8$ bytes
- **Answer**: $8$ bytes

### Convert $1024$ bits to bytes

- $1024 \div 8 = 128$ bytes
- **Answer**: $128$ bytes

### Convert $5000$ bits to bytes

- $5000 \div 8 = 625$ bytes
- **Answer**: $625$ bytes

### Convert $12345$ bits to bytes

- $12345 \div 8 = 1543.125$ bytes
- **Answer**: $1543.125$ bytes
- (generally here, we would round to the nearest whole byte).
