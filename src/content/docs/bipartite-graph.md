title: Bipartite graph
---

A *bipartite graph* is a type of [graph](/graph) where the
[vertices](/graph-vertex) can be divided into two groups.

No two vertices within the same group are connected by an
[edge](/graph-edge). Instead, edges only connect vertices from one group to
vertices in the other group.

## Complete bipartite graph

A *complete bipartite graph* is a special type of bipartite graph where
every vertex in one group is connected to every vertex in the other group.

### Notation

A complete bipartite graph with groups of sizes *m* and *n* is often written as
$K_{m,n}$.

### Number of edges

A complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ has $m \times n$ edges, since each of the
*m* vertices in one group is connected to all *n* vertices in the other group.

$$
\text{Number of edges} = m \times n
$$
