title: Potential divider
---

A potential divider consists of an $8.0 \Omega$ resistor, R, in series with a
$12.0 \Omega$ resistor and a $6.0 V$ power supply.

Calculate:
- the current
- the p.d. across each resistor

- Calculating the current:
  - Total resistance = $12.0 \Omega + 8.0 \Omega = 20.0 \Omega$
  - $V=IR$ -> $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{6.0 V}{20.0 \Omega}=0.30 A$
- Calculating the p.d. across each resistor:
  - $I=0.30 A$
  - $R_1=12.0 \Omega$:
    - $V_1=IR_1=0.30 A \times 12.0 \Omega=3.6 V$
  - $R_2=8.0 \Omega$:
    - $V_2=IR_2=0.30 A \times 8.0 \Omega=2.4 V$
  - Check that they add back up to the EMF:
    - $V_1 + V_2 = 3.6 V + 2.4 V = 6.0 V$

## What if one of the resistors is variable?

- If one resistor can change, the ratio of resistances will change.
- This will then change the p.d. across each resistor.
- This is useful in sensors - e.g. an LDR or thermistor.

### A potential divider consists of an $8.0 \Omega$ resistor, R, in series with a thermistor and a $6.0 V$ power supply. Calculate the p.d. across $R$ at each temperature.

> The thermistor has a resistance of $16.0 \Omega$ at 20°C and $6.0 \Omega$ at
  100°C.

- At 20°C:
  - $R_{total} = 8.0 \Omega + 16.0 \Omega = 24.0 \Omega$
  - $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{6.0 V}{24.0 \Omega}=0.25 A$
  - $V_R=IR=0.25 A \times 8.0 \Omega=2.0 V$
- At 100°C:
  - $R_{total} = 8.0 \Omega + 6.0 \Omega = 14.0 \Omega$
  - $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{6.0 V}{14.0 \Omega}=0.43 A$
  - $V_R=IR=0.43 A \times 8.0 \Omega=3.4 V$
