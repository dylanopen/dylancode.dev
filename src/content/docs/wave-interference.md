title: Wave interference
---

*Interference*, or *superposition* is when two or more waves 'overlap' in the same place at the
same time.

The *amplitude* of the resulting wave changes depending on the amplitudes of the
individual waves and how they line up with each other.

## Calculating superposition

The amplitude of the resulting wave can be calculated by **adding** the
amplitudes of the individual waves together.

> This is the *principle of superposition*.

For example, if two waves with amplitudes of 3 cm and 5 cm overlap, the
resulting wave will have an amplitude of 8 cm (because $3 + 5 = 8$).

## Supercrests

A *supercrest* is formed when two or more ***crests*** meet.

It results in a wave that has a much *higher* amplitude than the individual
waves, because the amplitudes of the individual waves add together.

For example, if two waves with amplitudes of 4 cm and 6 cm meet at their
crests, the resulting wave will have an amplitude of 10 cm (because $4 + 6 =
10$).

## Supertroughs

A *supertrough* is the opposite - it's formed when two or more ***troughs***
meet.

This results in a wave that has a very *low* (negative) amplitude, because the
amplitudes of the individual waves add together in the negative direction.

You can explain this with an example: if two waves with amplitudes of -3 cm and
-7 cm meet at their troughs, the resulting wave will have an amplitude of -10 cm
(because $-3 + -7 = -10$).

## Minimums

A *minimum* is formed when a crest and a trough meet. Because one of the waves
has a positive amplitude (the crest) at that point, but the other one has a
negative amplitude (the trough), the amplitudes will cancel each other out to
some extent.

For example, if a wave with an amplitude of 5 cm meets a wave with an amplitude of
-3 cm, the resulting wave will have an amplitude of 2 cm (because $5 + -3 = 2$).

If the crest and trough have the same amplitude (for example, 4 cm and -4 cm),
they will completely cancel each other out, resulting in an amplitude of 0 cm
(because $4 + -4 = 0$).
