title: Bit rate
---

The bit rate is the number of bits that are transmitted per second over the
wire.

For example, if we have a bit rate of 9600, that means that there are 9600 bits
transmitted per second.

The bit rate is different from the [baud rate](/baud-rate), which is the number
of signal changes per second. The bit rate can be higher than the baud rate if
we use a *modulation* scheme which lets us encode more than just one bit in 
every signal change.

The bit rate is the thing that determines how fast the data is transmitted,
e.g. your internet speed, or the speed of a USB connection, etc. The higher the
bit rate, the faster the data is transmitted (usually).

## Calculating bit rate

If we know the baud rate and the number of bits per signal change, we can
calculate the bit rate using the formula:

$$
\text{Bit rate} = \text{Baud rate} \times \text{Bits per signal change}
$$
