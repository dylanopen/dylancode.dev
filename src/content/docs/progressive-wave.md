title: Progressive wave
---

A *progressive wave* is a wave that transfers energy from one place to another
**without** the transfer of matter.

This means that the particles in the medium through which the wave is travelling
do not move along with the wave; instead, they oscillate (vibrate) around a
**fixed point**.

There are two [types of progressive waves](/types-of-wave) - transverse and
longitudinal.
