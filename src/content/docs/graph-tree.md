title: Graph tree
---

A *tree* is a type of [graph](/graph) that has the properties of:
- [being connected](/connected-graph)
- having **no** [loops](/graph-loop)

This means that there is exactly one path between any pair of
[vertices](/graph-vertex) in the tree.

It also means that it is impossible to start at one vertex and get back to it,
**without** repeating a vertex and edge along the way.
