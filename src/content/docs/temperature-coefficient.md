## Negative temperature coefficient (NTC)

- If an electrical resistor has a *lower* resistance at *higher* temperatures,
  it has a *negative temperature coefficient* (NTC).
- Usually, *thermistors* have a negative temperature coefficient.

## Positive temperature coefficient (PTC)

- If an electrical resistor has a *higher* resistance at *higher* temperatures,
  it has a *positive temperature coefficient* (PTC).
- Usually, *metallic conductors* have a positive temperature coefficient.
