title: Moment
---

A *moment* of a force is essentially a measure of how much a force causes an object to rotate about a point or axis. 

## What affects the moment?

The turning force about any point (P) will be *greater* if the:
- force is greater
- perpendicular distance from P to the line in the direction of the force

## What's the distance measuring?

Suppose we had this setup (p is the object, or pivot), and we pushed down at
point $A$:

```
P            A           
+------------+
 < -- 4m -- > 
```

The line of action of the force would be:

```
P            A           
+------------+
             |
             |
             |
             |
             |
```
