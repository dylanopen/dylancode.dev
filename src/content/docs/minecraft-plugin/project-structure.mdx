This is how to *manually* set up a Paper plugin project without a specific IDE -
it applies for any development environment you want, as long as you have a
terminal or command line interface to work with.

## File structure

Create a folder for your plugin - you can name it whatever you like. You'll need
these files and folders in it:

<FileTree>
- firstplugin/
  - build.gradle.kts
  - settings.gradle.kts
  - src/
    - main/
      - java/
        - dev.dylancode.firstplugin/
          - FirstPlugin.java
</FileTree>
