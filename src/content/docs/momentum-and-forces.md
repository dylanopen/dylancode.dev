title: Momentum and forces
---

There's a special link between the momentum of an object and the forces which
act on the object.

If we apply a force of $F$ newtons to an object, for $t$ seconds, the change in
momentum of the object (the [impulse](/impulse)) is the force multiplied by the
time for which the force is applied:

$$
\text{Impulse} = F \times t
$$

## Change in momentum

If we replace the word *impulse* with the change in momentum, we can write the
equation like this:

$$
\Delta p = F \times t
$$

## The full equation

We know that the equation for momentum is:

$$
p = mv
$$

That means we can replace $p$ for momentum with $mv$ in the first equation here:

$$
\Delta mv = F \times t
$$

You may see this rewritten as:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta mv}{t}
$$

Where:
- $F$ is the force in newtons ($N$)
- $\Delta mv$ is the change in momentum in kilogram meters per second
  ($kgms^{-1}$). Otherwise known as the [impulse](/impulse).
- $t$ is the time for which the force is applied in seconds ($s$)

## Force-time graphs

If we plot a graph with force on the y-axis and time on the x-axis:
- The y-axis will show the force, in Newtons ($N$)
- The x-axis will show the time, in seconds ($s$)
- We know that one *Newton* is one kilogram meter per second squared
  ($N = kgms^{-2}$) because a Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass
  of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared.
- So if we multiply the y-axis (force) by the x-axis (time), we get kilogram
  meters per second ($kgms^{-1}$), which is the unit for momentum!

That shows that:

> The **area** under a force-time graph is equal to the change in momentum (or
> [impulse](/impulse)) of the object.
