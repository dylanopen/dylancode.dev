The *arc* of a [sector](/sector) is the portion of the circumference that
connects the two radii of the sector.

In other words, it's the curved line on a sector.

There's a few things we can calculate for/from it, including:
- [finding the arc length from radians](/arc-length-from-radians)

> The arc is a *part* of the circumference of the circle.

## Minor arcs

The *minor arc* is the *smallest* arc of the circle - or the arc for the
*minor [sector](/sector)*.

It has an angle *less than* $\pi$ radians (under half the circle).

## Major arcs

The *major arc* is the *largest* arc of the circle - or the arc for the
*major [sector](/sector)*.

It has an angle *more than* $\pi$ radians (over half the circle).
