title: Friction
---

*Friction* is the force which opposes the motion of an object.

It's a type of *resistive force* (a force which opposes motion).

## Direction of action

Frictional forces act in the *opposite* direction to the motion of an object.

## When does friction occur?

Friction occurs when an object is moving, or trying to move, across a surface.

It's basically when the surface of an object is rubbing against another surface,
causing a force which opposes the motion of the object.

A thing to keep in mind is that friction can only *oppose* an *existing* force
or motion. It can't *create* a force or motion on its own - so basically, it
can only slow down an object rather than actually make it move.

## Types of friction

There are two main types of friction:
- **Static friction** - the frictional force which opposes the motion of an object which is *not* moving. It acts to prevent an object from starting to move.
- **Kinetic friction** - the frictional force which opposes the motion of an object which *is* moving. It acts to slow down an object which is already moving.
